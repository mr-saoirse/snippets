OAuth
OAuth is an open standard for ‘access delegation’, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It is the mechanism that enables “Log in with Google” on many sites, saving you from having to remember and manage yet another password. Like many auth-related topics, there’s a lot of depth and complexity to the OAuth standard, but once you understand the basic usage it can be a very convenient alternative to managing your own user accounts.
On this page you’ll see how to use OAuth with FastHTML to implement some common pieces of functionality.
In FastHTML you set up a client like GoogleAppClient
. The client is responsible for storing the client ID and client secret, and for handling the OAuth flow. Let’s run through three examples, illustrating some important concepts across three different OAuth providers.
A Minimal Login Flow (GitHub)
Let’s begin by building a minimal ‘Sign in with GitHub’ flow. This will demonstrate the basic steps of OAuth.
OAuth requires a “provider” (in this case, GitHub) to authenticate the user. So the first step when setting up our app is to register with GitHub to set things up.
Go to https://github.com/settings/developers and click “New OAuth App”. Fill in the form with the following values, then click ‘Register application’.
- Application name: Your app name
- Homepage URL: http://localhost:8000 (or whatever URL you’re using - you can change this later)
- Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:8000/auth_redirect (you can modify this later too)
You’ll then see a screen where you can view the client ID and generate a client secret. Copy these values and store them in a safe place.
These values are used to create a GitHubAppClient
object in FastHTML. This object is responsible for handling the OAuth flow. Here’s how you’d set this up:
= GitHubAppClient(
client ="your_client_id",
client_id="your_client_secret",
client_secret="http://localhost:8000/auth_redirect",
redirect_uri )
(It is recommended to store the client ID and secret in environment variables, rather than hardcoding them in your code.)
To start the OAuth flow, you need to redirect the user to the provider’s authorization URL. This URL is obtained by calling client.login_link()
.
Once you send a user to that link, they’ll be asked to grant your app permission to access their GitHub account. If they agree, GitHub will redirect them back to your site with a code that you can use to get an access token. To receive this code, you need to set up a route in FastHTML that listens for requests to your redirect uri (/auth_redirect
in this case). For example:
@app.get('/auth_redirect')
def auth_redirect(code:str):
return P(f"code: {code}")
This code is temporary, and is used to send a request to the provider from the server (up until now only the client has communicated with the provider). You can think of the exchange so far as:
- Client to us: “I want to log in”
- Us to client: “Here’s a link to log in”
- Client to provider: “I want to log in via this link”
- Provider to client: “OK, redirecting you to this URL (with a code)”
- Client to us: /auth_redirect?code=… (“Here’s the code you need to get the token”)
Next we need:
- Us to provider: “A user I told to log in just gave me this code, can I have a token please?”
- Provider to us: “Here’s the token”
- Us to provider: “Can I have the user’s details please? Here’s the token”
- Provider to us: “Here’s the user’s details”
To go from code to user details, you can use info = client.retr_info(code)
. Or, if all you need is a unique identifier for the user, you can just use retr_id
instead:
@app.get('/auth_redirect')
def auth_redirect(code:str):
= client.retr_id(code)
user_id return P(f"User id: {user_id}")
There’s not much use in just printing the user info - going forward we want to be able to persistently keep track of who this user is. One conveneint way to do this is to store the user ID in the session
object. Since this is cryptographically signed, it’s safe to store sensitive information here - the user can’t read it, but we can fetch it back out for any future requests they make. On the server side, you could also store this information in a database if you need to keep track of user info.
Here’s a minimal app that puts all these pieces together:
from fasthtml.common import *
from fasthtml.oauth import GitHubAppClient
# # Set up a database
= database('data/user_counts.db')
db = db.t.user_counts
user_counts if user_counts not in db.t:
dict(name=str, count=int), pk='name')
user_counts.create(= user_counts.dataclass()
Count
# Auth client setup for GitHub
= GitHubAppClient(os.getenv("AUTH_CLIENT_ID"),
client "AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"),
os.getenv(="http://localhost:8000/auth_redirect")
redirect_uri= client.login_link()
login_link
def before(req, session):
= req.scope['auth'] = session.get('user_id', None)
auth if not auth: return RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)
=auth)
user_counts.xtra(name= Beforeware(before, skip=['/login', '/auth_redirect'])
bware
= FastHTML(before=bware)
app
@app.get('/')
def home(auth):
return Div(
"Count demo"),
P(f"Count: ", Span(user_counts[auth].count, id='count')),
P('Increment', hx_get='/increment', hx_target='#count'),
Button('Logout', href='/logout')) # Link to log out,
P(A(
)
@app.get('/increment')
def increment(auth):
= user_counts[auth]
c += 1
c.count return user_counts.upsert(c).count
@app.get('/login')
def login(): return P(A('Login with GitHub', href=client.login_link()))
@app.get('/logout')
def logout(session):
'user_id', None)
session.pop(return RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)
@app.get('/auth_redirect')
def auth_redirect(code:str, session):
if not code: return "No code provided!"
= client.retr_id(code)
user_id 'user_id'] = user_id
session[if user_id not in user_counts:
=user_id, count=0)
user_counts.insert(namereturn RedirectResponse('/', status_code=303)
=8000) serve(port
Some things to note:
- The
before
function is used to check if the user is authenticated. If not, they are redirected to the login page. - To log the user out, we remove the user ID from the session.
- Calling
counts.xtra(name=auth)
ensures that only the row corresponding to the current user is accessible when responding to a request. This is often nicer than trying to remember to filter the data in every route, and lowers the risk of accidentally leaking data. - In the
auth_redirect
route, we store the user ID in the session and create a new row in theuser_counts
table if it doesn’t already exist.
You can find more heavily-commented version of this code in the oauth directory in fasthtml-example, along with an even more minimal example. More examples may be added in the future.
Revoking Tokens (Google)
When the user in the example above logs out, we remove their user ID from the session. However, the user is still logged in to GitHub. If they click ‘Login with GitHub’ again, they’ll be redirected back to our site without having to log in again. This is because GitHub remembers that they’ve already granted our app permission to access their account. Most of the time this is convenient, but for testing or security purposes you may want a way to revoke this permission.
As a user, you can usually revoke access to an app from the provider’s website (for example, https://github.com/settings/applications). But as a developer, you can also revoke access programmatically - at least with some providers. This requires keeping track of the access token (stored in client.token[“access_token”] after you call retr_info
), and sending a request to the provider’s revoke URL:
= "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke"
authoization_revoke_url def revoke_token(token):
= requests.post(authoization_revoke_url, params={"token": token})
response return response.status_code == 200 # True if successful
Not all proivders support token revocation, and it is not built into FastHTML clients at the moment.
Using State (Hugging Face)
Imagine a user (not logged in) comes to your AI image editing site, starts testing things out, and then realizes they need to sign in before they can click “Run (Pro)” on the edit they’re working on. They click “Sign in with Hugging Face”, log in, and are redirected back to your site. But now they’ve lost their in-progress edit and are left just looking at the homepage! This is an example of a case where you might want to keep track of some additional state. Another strong use case for being able to pass some uniqie state through the OAuth flow is to prevent something called a CSRF attack. To add a state string to the OAuth flow, you can use client.login_link_with_state(state)
instead of client.login_link()
, like so:
# in login page:
= A('Login with GitHub', href=client.login_link_with_state(state='current_prompt: add a unicorn'))
link
# in auth_redirect:
@app.get('/auth_redirect')
def auth_redirect(code:str, session, state:str=None):
print(f"state: {state}") # Use as needed
...
The state string is passed through the OAuth flow and back to your site.
A Work in Progress
This page (and OAuth support in FastHTML) is a work in progress. Questions, PRs, and feedback are welcome!It can sometimes be useful to pass state to the OAuth provider, so that when the user returns you can pick up where they left off. This can be done by using the login_link_with_state function with a state parameter:
TODO: do all providers support this the same way? This is only tested for HF atm.
Call retr_info and then return id/subscriber value
After logging in via the provider, the user will be redirected back to the supplied redirect URL. The request to this URL will contain a code parameter, which is used to get an access token and fetch the user’s profile information. See the explainanation here for a worked example. You can either:
use client.retr_info(code) to get all the profile information, or
use client.retr_id(code) to get just the user’s ID.
After either of these calls, you can also access the access token (used to revoke access, for example) with client.token["access_token"].FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions
Why is FastHTML developed using notebooks?
Some people are under the impression that writing software in notebooks is bad.
Watch this video. We’ve used Jupyter notebooks exported via nbdev
to write a wide range of “very serious” software projects over the last three years. This includes deep learning libraries, API clients, Python language extensions, terminal user interfaces, web frameworks, and more!
nbdev is a Jupyter-powered tool for writing software. Traditional programming environments throw away the result of your exploration in REPLs or notebooks. nbdev
makes exploration an integral part of your workflow, all while promoting software engineering best practices.
Why not pyproject.toml for packaging?
FastHTML uses a setup.py
module instead of a pyproject.toml
file to configure itself for installation. The reason for this is pyproject.toml
is not compatible with nbdev, which is what is used to write and build FastHTML.
The nbdev project spent around a year trying to move to pyproject.toml but there was insufficient functionality in the toml-based approach to complete the transition. We invite those interested in moving this project pyproject.toml
to contribute their efforts to making nbdev work with that format.
Why not JSX?
Many have asked! We think there’s no benefit… Python’s positional and kw args precisely 1:1 map already to html/xml children and attrs, so there’s no need for a new syntax.
We wrote some more thoughts on Why Python HTML components over Jinja2, Mako, or JSX here.
Why use import *
First, through the use of the __all__
attribute in our Python modules we control what actually gets imported. So there’s no risk of namespace pollution.
Second, our style lends itself to working in rather compact Jupyter notebooks and small Python modules. Hence we know about the source code whose libraries we import *
from. This terseness means we can develop faster. We’re a small team, and any edge we can gain is important to us.
Third, for external libraries, be it core Python, SQLAlchemy, or other things we do tend to use explicit imports. In part to avoid namespace collisions, and also as reference to know where things are coming from.
We’ll finish by saying a lot of our users employ explicit imports. If that’s the path you want to take, we encourage the use of from fasthtml import common as fh
. The acronym of fh
makes it easy to recognize that a symbol is from the FastHTML library.
Can FastHTML be used for dashboards?
Yes it can. In fact, it excels at building dashboards. In addition to being great for building static dashboards, because of its foundation in ASGI and tech stack, FastHTML natively supports Websockets. That means using FastHTML we can create dashboards that autoupdate.
Why the distinctive coding style?
FastHTML coding style is the fastai coding style.
If you are coming from a data science background the fastai coding style may already be your preferred style.
If you are coming from a PEP-8 background where the use of ruff is encouraged, we won’t deny there is a learning curve. However, once you get used to the fastai coding style you may discover yourself appreciating the concise nature of this style. It also encourages using more functional programming tooling, which is both productive and fun.Live Reloading
When building your app it can be useful to view your changes in a web browser as you make them. FastHTML supports live reloading which means that it watches for any changes to your code and automatically refreshes the webpage in your browser.
To enable live reloading simply replace FastHTML
in your app with FastHTMLWithLiveReload
.
from fasthtml.common import *
= FastHTMLWithLiveReload() app
Then in your terminal run uvicorn
with reloading enabled.
uvicorn main:app --reload
⚠️ Gotchas - A reload is only triggered when you save your changes. - FastHTMLWithLiveReload
should only be used during development. - If your app spans multiple directories you might need to use the --reload-dir
flag to watch all files in each directory. See the uvicorn docs for more info.
Live reloading with fast_app
In development the fast_app
function provides the same functionality. It instantiates the FastHTMLWithLiveReload
class if you pass live=True
:
- 1
-
fast_app()
instantiates theFastHTMLWithLiveReload
class. - 2
-
serve()
is a wrapper around auvicorn
call.
To run main.py
in live reload mode, just do python main.py
. We recommend turning off live reload when deploying your app to production.from lxml import html as lx

Routes
Behaviour in FastHTML apps is defined by routes. The syntax is largely the same as the wonderful FastAPI (which is what you should be using instead of this if you’re creating a JSON service. FastHTML is mainly for making HTML web apps, not APIs).
We haven’t yet written complete documentation of all of FastHTML’s routing features – until we add that, the best place to see all the available functionality is to look over the tests
Note that you need to include the types of your parameters, so that FastHTML
knows what to pass to your function. Here, we’re just expecting a string:
= FastHTML()
app
@app.get('/user/{nm}')
def get_nm(nm:str): return f"Good day to you, {nm}!"
Normally you’d save this into a file such as main.py, and then run it in uvicorn
using:
uvicorn main:app
However, for testing, we can use Starlette’s TestClient
to try it out:
from starlette.testclient import TestClient
= TestClient(app)
client = client.get('/user/Jeremy')
r r
<Response [200 OK]>
TestClient uses httpx
behind the scenes, so it returns a httpx.Response
, which has a text
attribute with our response body:
r.text
'Good day to you, Jeremy!'
In the previous example, the function name (get_nm
) didn’t actually matter – we could have just called it _
, for instance, since we never actually call it directly. It’s just called through HTTP. In fact, we often do call our functions _
when using this style of route, since that’s one less thing we have to worry about, naming.
An alternative approach to creating a route is to use app.route
instead, in which case, you make the function name the HTTP method you want. Since this is such a common pattern, you might like to give a shorter name to app.route
– we normally use rt
:
= app.route
rt
@rt('/')
def post(): return "Going postal!"
'/').text client.post(
'Going postal!'
Route-specific functionality
FastHTML supports custom decorators for adding specific functionality to routes. This allows you to implement authentication, authorization, middleware, or other custom behaviors for individual routes.
Here’s an example of a basic authentication decorator:
from functools import wraps
def basic_auth(f):
@wraps(f)
async def wrapper(req, *args, **kwargs):
= req.headers.get("Authorization")
token if token == 'abc123':
return await f(req, *args, **kwargs)
return Response('Not Authorized', status_code=401)
return wrapper
@app.get("/protected")
@basic_auth
async def protected(req):
return "Protected Content"
'/protected', headers={'Authorization': 'abc123'}).text client.get(
'Protected Content'
The decorator intercepts the request before the route function executes. If the decorator allows the request to proceed, it calls the original route function, passing along the request and any other arguments.
One of the key advantages of this approach is the ability to apply different behaviors to different routes. You can also stack multiple decorators on a single route for combined functionality.
def app_beforeware():
print('App level beforeware')
= FastHTML(before=Beforeware(app_beforeware))
app = TestClient(app)
client
def route_beforeware(f):
@wraps(f)
async def decorator(*args, **kwargs):
print('Route level beforeware')
return await f(*args, **kwargs)
return decorator
def second_route_beforeware(f):
@wraps(f)
async def decorator(*args, **kwargs):
print('Second route level beforeware')
return await f(*args, **kwargs)
return decorator
@app.get("/users")
@route_beforeware
@second_route_beforeware
async def users():
return "Users Page"
'/users').text client.get(
App level beforeware
Route level beforeware
Second route level beforeware
'Users Page'
This flexiblity allows for granular control over route behaviour, enabling you to tailor each endpoint’s functionality as needed. While app-level beforeware remains useful for global operations, decorators provide a powerful tool for route-specific customization.
Combining Routes
Sometimes a FastHTML project can grow so weildy that putting all the routes into main.py
becomes unweildy. Or, we install a FastHTML- or Starlette-based package that requires us to add routes.
First let’s create a books.py
module, that represents all the user-related views:
# books.py
= fast_app()
books_app, rt
= ['A Guide to FastHTML', 'FastHTML Cookbook', 'FastHTML in 24 Hours']
books
@rt("/", name="list")
def get():
return Titled("Books", *[P(book) for book in books])
Let’s mount it in our main module:
from books import app as books_app
1= fast_app(routes=[Mount("/books", books_app, name="books")])
app, rt
@rt("/")
def get():
return Titled("Dashboard",
2="/books")("Books")),
P(A(href
Hr(),3=uri("books:list"))("Books")),
P(A(link
)
serve()
- 1
-
We use
starlette.Mount
to add the route to our routes list. We provide the name ofbooks
to make discovery and management of the links easier. More on that in items 2 and 3 of this annotations list - 2
- This example link to the books list view is hand-crafted. Obvious in purpose, it makes changing link patterns in the future harder
- 3
- This example link uses the named URL route for the books. The advantage of this approach is it makes management of large numbers of link items easier.Tutorials

ft Components
In a nutshell, ft components turn Python objects into HTML.
ft, or ‘FastTags’, are the display components of FastHTML. In fact, the word “components” in the context of FastHTML is often synonymous with ft.
For example, when we look at a FastHTML app, in particular the views, as well as various functions and other objects, we see something like the code snippet below. It’s the return
statement that we want to pay attention to:
Let’s go ahead and call our function and print the result:
example()
div class="go">
<h1>FastHTML APP</h1>
<p>Let's do this</p>
<div> </
As you can see, when returned to the user from a Python callable, like a function, the ft components are transformed into their string representations of XML or XML-like content such as HTML. More concisely, ft turns Python objects into HTML.
Now that we know what ft components look and behave like we can begin to understand them. At their most fundamental level, ft components:
- Are Python callables, specifically functions, classes, methods of classes, lambda functions, and anything else called with parenthesis that returns a value.
- Return a sequence of values which has three elements:
- The tag to be generated
- The content of the tag, which is a tuple of strings/tuples. If a tuple, it is the three-element structure of an ft component
- A dictionary of XML attributes and their values
- FastHTML’s default ft components words begin with an uppercase letter. Examples include
Title()
,Ul()
, andDiv()
Custom components have included things likeBlogPost
andCityMap
.
How FastHTML names ft components
When it comes to naming ft components, FastHTML appears to break from PEP8. Specifically, PEP8 specifies that when naming variables, functions and instantiated classes we use the snake_case_pattern
. That is to say, lowercase with words separated by underscores. However, FastHTML uses PascalCase
for ft components.
There’s a couple of reasons for this:
- ft components can be made from any callable type, so adhering to any one pattern doesn’t make much sense
- It makes for easier reading of FastHTML code, as anything that is PascalCase is probably an ft component
Default ft components
FastHTML has over 150 ft components designed to accelerate web development. Most of these mirror HTML tags such as <div>
, <p>
, <a>
, <title>
, and more. However, there are some extra tags added, including:
The fasthtml.ft
Namespace
Some people prefer to write code using namespaces while adhering to PEP8. If that’s a preference, projects can be coded using the fasthtml.ft
namespace.
from fasthtml import ft
ft.Ul("one"),
ft.Li("two"),
ft.Li("three")
ft.Li( )
ul>
<li>one</li>
<li>two</li>
<li>three</li>
<ul> </
Attributes
This example demonstrates many important things to know about how ft components handle attributes.
#| echo: False
1Label(
"Choose an option",
Select(
2 Option("one", value="1", selected=True),
3 Option("two", value="2", selected=False),
4 Option("three", value=3),
5 cls="selector",
6 _id="counter",
7 **{'@click':"alert('Clicked');"},
),
8 _for="counter",
)
- 1
-
Line 2 demonstrates that FastHTML appreciates
Label
s surrounding their fields. - 2
-
On line 5, we can see that attributes set to the
boolean
value ofTrue
are rendered with just the name of the attribute. - 3
-
On line 6, we demonstrate that attributes set to the
boolean
value ofFalse
do not appear in the rendered output. - 4
- Line 7 is an example of how integers and other non-string values in the rendered output are converted to strings.
- 5
-
Line 8 is where we set the HTML class using the
cls
argument. We usecls
here asclass
is a reserved word in Python. During the rendering process this will be converted to the word “class”. - 6
- Line 9 demonstrates that any named argument passed into an ft component will have the leading underscore stripped away before rendering. Useful for handling reserved words in Python.
- 7
-
On line 10 we have an attribute name that cannot be represented as a python variable. In cases like these, we can use an unpacked
dict
to represent these values. - 8
-
The use of
_for
on line 12 is another demonstration of an argument having the leading underscore stripped during render. We can also usefr
as that will be expanded tofor
.
This renders the following HTML snippet:
Label("Choose an option",
Select("one", value="1", selected=True),
Option("two", value="2", selected=False),
Option("three", value=3), # <4>,
Option(="selector",
cls="counter",
_id**{'@click':"alert('Clicked');"},
),="counter",
_for )
label for="counter">
<
Choose an optionselect id="counter" @click="alert('Clicked');" class="selector" name="counter">
<option value="1" selected>one</option>
<<option value="2" >two</option>
option value="3">three</option>
<select>
</label> </
Defining new ft components
It is possible and sometimes useful to create your own ft components that generate non-standard tags that are not in the FastHTML library. FastHTML supports created and defining those new tags flexibly.
For more information, see the Defining new ft components reference page.import time

Core
This is the source code to fasthtml. You won’t need to read this unless you want to understand how things are built behind the scenes, or need full details of a particular API. The notebook is converted to the Python module fasthtml/core.py using nbdev.
Imports and utils
We write source code first, and then tests come after. The tests serve as both a means to confirm that the code works and also serves as working examples. The first declared function, date
, is an example of this pattern.

*Creates an application instance.
Parameters:
- debug - Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
- routes - A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
- middleware - A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always automatically include two middleware classes.
ServerErrorMiddleware
is added as the very outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.ExceptionMiddleware
is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints. - exception_handlers - A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto callables which handle the exceptions. Exception handler callables should be of the form
handler(request, exc) -> response
and may be either standard functions, or async functions. - on_startup - A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
- on_shutdown - A list of callables to run on application shutdown. Shutdown handler callables do not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
- lifespan - A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform startup and shutdown tasks. This is a newer style that replaces the
on_startup
andon_shutdown
handlers. Use one or the other, not both.*

FastHTML By Example
There are lots of non-FastHTML-specific tricks and patterns involved in building web apps. The main goal of this tutorial is to give an alternate introduction to FastHTML. Building out example applications to show common patterns used. Also, illustrate some of the ways you can build on top of the FastHTML foundations to create your own custom web apps. A secondary goal is to have this be a useful document to add to the context of an LLM to turn it into a useful FastHTML assistant.
Let’s get started.
FastHTML Basics
FastHTML is just Python. You can install it with pip install python-fasthtml
. Extensions/components built for it can likewise be distributed via PyPI or as simple Python files.
The core usage of FastHTML is to define routes, and then to define what to do at each route. This is similar to the FastAPI web framework (in fact we implemented much of the functionality to match the FastAPI usage examples), but where FastAPI focuses on returning JSON data to build APIs, FastHTML focuses on returning HTML data.
Here’s a simple FastHTML app that returns a “Hello, World” message:
To run this app, place it in a file, say app.py
, and then run it with uvicorn app:app --reload
. (We recommend that Windows users run the Uvicorn server via WSL to avoid this issue.) You’ll see a message like this:
INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/home/jonathan/fasthtml-example']
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO: Started reloader process [871942] using WatchFiles
INFO: Started server process [871945]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
If you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in a browser, you’ll see your “Hello, World”. If you edit the app.py
file and save it, the server will reload and you’ll see the updated message when you refresh the page in your browser.
Constructing HTML
Notice we wrote some HTML in the previous example. We don’t want to do that! Some web frameworks require that you learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript AND some templating language AND python. We want to do as much as possible with just one language. Fortunately, the Python module fastcore.xml has all we need for constructing HTML from Python, and FastHTML includes all the tags you need to get started. For example:
from fasthtml.common import *
= Html(
page 'Some page')),
Head(Title('Some text, ', A('A link', href='https://example.com'), Img(src="https://placehold.co/200"), cls='myclass')))
Body(Div(print(to_xml(page))
<!doctype html></!doctype>
<html>
<head>
<title>Some page</title>
</head>
<body>
<div class="myclass">
Some text,
<a href="https://example.com">A link</a>
<img src="https://placehold.co/200">
</div>
</body>
</html>
show(page)
If that import *
worries you, you can always import only the tags you need.
FastHTML is smart enough to know about fastcore.xml, and so you don’t need to use the to_xml
function to convert your FT objects to HTML. You can just return them as you would any other Python object. For example, if we modify our previous example to use fastcore.xml, we can return an FT object directly:
= FastHTML()
app
@app.get("/")
def home():
return Div(H1('Hello, World'), P('Some text'), P('Some more text'))
This will render the HTML in the browser.
For debugging, you can right-click on the rendered HTML in the browser and select “Inspect” to see the underlying HTML that was generated. There you’ll also find the ‘network’ tab, which shows you the requests that were made to render the page. Refresh and look for the request to 127.0.0.1
- and you’ll see it’s just a GET
request to /
, and the response body is the HTML you just returned.
You can also use Starlette’s TestClient
to try it out in a notebook:
from starlette.testclient import TestClient
= TestClient(app)
client = client.get("/")
r r.text
'<!doctype html></!doctype>\n\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>FastHTML page</title>\n <meta charset="utf-8"></meta>\n <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover"></meta>\n <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@next/dist/htmx.min.js"></script>\n <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/answerdotai/[email protected]/surreal.js"></script>\n <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gnat/css-scope-inline@main/script.js"></script>\n </head>\n <body>\n<div>\n <h1>Hello, World</h1>\n <p>Some text</p>\n <p>Some more text</p>\n</div>\n </body>\n</html>\n'
FastHTML wraps things in an Html tag if you don’t do it yourself (unless the request comes from htmx, in which case you get the element directly). See the section ‘FT objects and HTML’ for more on creating custom components or adding HTML rendering to existing python objects. To give the page a non-default title, return a Title before your main content:
= FastHTML()
app
@app.get("/")
def home():
return Title("Page Demo"), Div(H1('Hello, World'), P('Some text'), P('Some more text'))
= TestClient(app)
client print(client.get("/").text)
<!doctype html></!doctype>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Demo</title>
<meta charset="utf-8"></meta>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover"></meta>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@next/dist/htmx.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/answerdotai/[email protected]/surreal.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gnat/css-scope-inline@main/script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div>
<h1>Hello, World</h1>
<p>Some text</p>
<p>Some more text</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
We’ll use this pattern often in the examples to follow.
Defining Routes
The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods (‘verbs’) to send requests to a server. The most common are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. We saw ‘GET’ in action before - when you navigate to a URL, you’re making a GET request to that URL. We can do different things on a route for different HTTP methods. For example:
@app.route("/", methods='get')
def home():
return H1('Hello, World')
@app.route("/", methods=['post', 'put'])
def post_or_put():
return "got a POST or PUT request"
This says that when someone navigates to the root URL “/” (i.e. sends a GET request), they will see the big “Hello, World” heading. When someone submits a POST or PUT request to the same URL, the server should return the string “got a post or put request”.
Aside: You can test the POST request with curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000 -d "some data"
. This sends some data to the server, you should see the response “got a post or put request” printed in the terminal.
There are a few other ways you can specify the route+method - FastHTML has .get
, .post
, etc. as shorthand for route(..., methods=['get'])
, etc.
@app.get("/")
def my_function():
return "Hello World from a GET request"
Or you can use the @app.route
decorator without a method but specify the method with the name of the function. For example:
@app.route("/")
def post():
return "Hello World from a POST request"
"/").text client.post(
'Hello World from a POST request'
You’re welcome to pick whichever style you prefer. Using routes lets you show different content on different pages - ‘/home’, ‘/about’ and so on. You can also respond differently to different kinds of requests to the same route, as shown above. You can also pass data via the route:
@app.get("/greet/{nm}")
def greet(nm:str):
return f"Good day to you, {nm}!"
"/greet/Dave").text client.get(
'Good day to you, Dave!'
More on this in the ‘More on Routing and Request Parameters’ section, which goes deeper into the different ways to get information from a request.
Styling Basics
Plain HTML probably isn’t quite what you imagine when you visualize your beautiful web app. CSS is the go-to language for styling HTML. But again, we don’t want to learn extra languages unless we absolutely have to! Fortunately, there are ways to get much more visually appealing sites by relying on the hard work of others, using existing CSS libraries. One of our favourites is PicoCSS. To add a CSS file to HTML, you can use the <link>
tag. Since we typically want things like CSS styling on all pages of our app, FastHTML lets you add shared headers when you define your app. And it already has picolink
defined for convenience. As per the pico docs, we put all of our content inside a <main>
tag with a class of container
:
from fasthtml.common import *
# App with custom styling to override the pico defaults
= Style(':root { --pico-font-size: 100%; --pico-font-family: Pacifico, cursive;}')
css = FastHTML(hdrs=(picolink, css))
app
@app.route("/")
def get():
return Title("Hello World"), Main(H1('Hello, World'), cls="container")
Aside: We’re returning a tuple here (a title and the main page). This is needed to tell FastHTML to turn the main body into a full HTML page that includes the headers (including the pico link and our custom css) which we passed in.
You can check out the Pico examples page to see how different elements will look. If everything is working, the page should now render nice text with our custom font, and it should respect the user’s light/dark mode preferences too.
If you want to override the default styles or add more custom CSS, you can do so by adding a <style>
tag to the headers as shown above. So you are allowed to write CSS to your heart’s content - we just want to make sure you don’t necessarily have to! Later on we’ll see examples using other component libraries and tailwind css to do more fancy styling things, along with tips to get an LLM to write all those fiddly bits so you don’t have to.
Web Page -> Web App
Showing content is all well and good, but we typically expect a bit more interactivity from something calling itself a web app! So, let’s add a few different pages, and use a form to let users add messages to a list:
= FastHTML()
app = ["This is a message, which will get rendered as a paragraph"]
messages
@app.get("/")
def home():
return Main(H1('Messages'),
*[P(msg) for msg in messages],
"Link to Page 2 (to add messages)", href="/page2"))
A(
@app.get("/page2")
def page2():
return Main(P("Add a message with the form below:"),
type="text", name="data"),
Form(Input("Submit"),
Button(="/", method="post"))
action
@app.post("/")
def add_message(data:str):
messages.append(data)return home()
We re-render the entire homepage to show the newly added message. This is fine, but modern web apps often don’t re-render the entire page, they just update a part of the page. In fact even very complicated applications are often implemented as ‘Single Page Apps’ (SPAs). This is where HTMX comes in.
HTMX
HTMX addresses some key limitations of HTML. In vanilla HTML, links can trigger a GET request to show a new page, and forms can send requests containing data to the server. A lot of ‘Web 1.0’ design revolved around ways to use these to do everything we wanted. But why should only some elements be allowed to trigger requests? And why should we refresh the entire page with the result each time one does? HTMX extends HTML to allow us to trigger requests from any element on all kinds of events, and to update a part of the page without refreshing the entire page. It’s a powerful tool for building modern web apps.
It does this by adding attributes to HTML tags to make them do things. For example, here’s a page with a counter and a button that increments it:
= FastHTML()
app
= 0
count
@app.get("/")
def home():
return Title("Count Demo"), Main(
"Count Demo"),
H1(f"Count is set to {count}", id="count"),
P("Increment", hx_post="/increment", hx_target="#count", hx_swap="innerHTML")
Button(
)
@app.post("/increment")
def increment():
print("incrementing")
global count
+= 1
count return f"Count is set to {count}"
The button triggers a POST request to /increment
(since we set hx_post="/increment"
), which increments the count and returns the new count. The hx_target
attribute tells HTMX where to put the result. If no target is specified it replaces the element that triggered the request. The hx_swap
attribute specifies how it adds the result to the page. Useful options are:
innerHTML
: Replace the target element’s content with the result.outerHTML
: Replace the target element with the result.beforebegin
: Insert the result before the target element.beforeend
: Insert the result inside the target element, after its last child.afterbegin
: Insert the result inside the target element, before its first child.afterend
: Insert the result after the target element.
You can also use an hx_swap of delete
to delete the target element regardless of response, or of none
to do nothing.
By default, requests are triggered by the “natural” event of an element - click in the case of a button (and most other elements). You can also specify different triggers, along with various modifiers - see the HTMX docs for more.
This pattern of having elements trigger requests that modify or replace other elements is a key part of the HTMX philosophy. It takes a little getting used to, but once mastered it is extremely powerful.
Replacing Elements Besides the Target
Sometimes having a single target is not enough, and we’d like to specify some additional elements to update or remove. In these cases, returning elements with an id that matches the element to be replaced and hx_swap_oob='true'
will replace those elements too. We’ll use this in the next example to clear an input field when we submit a form.
Full Example #1 - ToDo App
The canonical demo web app! A TODO list. Rather than create yet another variant for this tutorial, we recommend starting with this video tutorial from Jeremy:
We’ve made a number of variants of this app - so in addition to the version shown in the video you can browse this series of examples with increasing complexity, the heavily-commented “idiomatic” version here, and the example linked from the FastHTML homepage.
Full Example #2 - Image Generation App
Let’s create an image generation app. We’d like to wrap a text-to-image model in a nice UI, where the user can type in a prompt and see a generated image appear. We’ll use a model hosted by Replicate to actually generate the images. Let’s start with the homepage, with a form to submit prompts and a div to hold the generated images:
# Main page
@app.get("/")
def get():
= Input(id="new-prompt", name="prompt", placeholder="Enter a prompt")
inp = Form(Group(inp, Button("Generate")), hx_post="/", target_id='gen-list', hx_swap="afterbegin")
add = Div(id='gen-list')
gen_list return Title('Image Generation Demo'), Main(H1('Magic Image Generation'), add, gen_list, cls='container')
Submitting the form will trigger a POST request to /
, so next we need to generate an image and add it to the list. One problem: generating images is slow! We’ll start the generation in a separate thread, but this now surfaces a different problem: we want to update the UI right away, but our image will only be ready a few seconds later. This is a common pattern - think about how often you see a loading spinner online. We need a way to return a temporary bit of UI which will eventually be replaced by the final image. Here’s how we might do this:
def generation_preview(id):
if os.path.exists(f"gens/{id}.png"):
return Div(Img(src=f"/gens/{id}.png"), id=f'gen-{id}')
else:
return Div("Generating...", id=f'gen-{id}',
=f"/generations/{id}",
hx_post='every 1s', hx_swap='outerHTML')
hx_trigger
@app.post("/generations/{id}")
def get(id:int): return generation_preview(id)
@app.post("/")
def post(prompt:str):
id = len(generations)
id)
generate_and_save(prompt,
generations.append(prompt)= Input(id="new-prompt", name="prompt", placeholder="Enter a prompt", hx_swap_oob='true')
clear_input return generation_preview(id), clear_input
@threaded
def generate_and_save(prompt, id): ...
The form sends the prompt to the /
route, which starts the generation in a separate thread then returns two things:
- A generation preview element that will be added to the top of the
gen-list
div (since that is the target_id of the form which triggered the request) - An input field that will replace the form’s input field (that has the same id), using the hx_swap_oob=‘true’ trick. This clears the prompt field so the user can type another prompt.
The generation preview first returns a temporary “Generating…” message, which polls the /generations/{id}
route every second. This is done by setting hx_post to the route and hx_trigger to ‘every 1s’. The /generations/{id}
route returns the preview element every second until the image is ready, at which point it returns the final image. Since the final image replaces the temporary one (hx_swap=‘outerHTML’), the polling stops running and the generation preview is now complete.
This works nicely - the user can submit several prompts without having to wait for the first one to generate, and as the images become available they are added to the list. You can see the full code of this version here.
Again, with Style
The app is functional, but can be improved. The next version adds more stylish generation previews, lays out the images in a grid layout that is responsive to different screen sizes, and adds a database to track generations and make them persistent. The database part is very similar to the todo list example, so let’s just quickly look at how we add the nice grid layout. This is what the result looks like:
Step one was looking around for existing components. The Pico CSS library we’ve been using has a rudimentary grid but recommends using an alternative layout system. One of the options listed was Flexbox.
To use Flexbox you create a “row” with one or more elements. You can specify how wide things should be with a specific syntax in the class name. For example, col-xs-12
means a box that will take up 12 columns (out of 12 total) of the row on extra small screens, col-sm-6
means a column that will take up 6 columns of the row on small screens, and so on. So if you want four columns on large screens you would use col-lg-3
for each item (i.e. each item is using 3 columns out of 12).
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12">
<div class="box">This takes up the full width</div>
</div>
</div>
This was non-intuitive to me. Thankfully ChatGPT et al know web stuff quite well, and we can also experiment in a notebook to test things out:
= Html(
grid ="stylesheet", href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flexboxgrid/6.3.1/flexboxgrid.min.css", type="text/css"),
Link(rel
Div("This takes up the full width", cls="box", style="background-color: #800000;"), cls="col-xs-12"),
Div(Div("This takes up half", cls="box", style="background-color: #008000;"), cls="col-xs-6"),
Div(Div("This takes up half", cls="box", style="background-color: #0000B0;"), cls="col-xs-6"),
Div(Div(="row", style="color: #fff;"
cls
)
) show(grid)
Aside: when in doubt with CSS stuff, add a background color or a border so you can see what’s happening!
Translating this into our app, we have a new homepage with a div (class="row")
to store the generated images / previews, and a generation_preview
function that returns boxes with the appropriate classes and styles to make them appear in the grid. I chose a layout with different numbers of columns for different screen sizes, but you could also just specify the col-xs
class if you wanted the same layout on all devices.
= Link(rel="stylesheet", href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flexboxgrid/6.3.1/flexboxgrid.min.css", type="text/css")
gridlink = FastHTML(hdrs=(picolink, gridlink))
app
# Main page
@app.get("/")
def get():
= Input(id="new-prompt", name="prompt", placeholder="Enter a prompt")
inp = Form(Group(inp, Button("Generate")), hx_post="/", target_id='gen-list', hx_swap="afterbegin")
add = [generation_preview(g) for g in gens(limit=10)] # Start with last 10
gen_containers = Div(*gen_containers[::-1], id='gen-list', cls="row") # flexbox container: class = row
gen_list return Title('Image Generation Demo'), Main(H1('Magic Image Generation'), add, gen_list, cls='container')
# Show the image (if available) and prompt for a generation
def generation_preview(g):
= "box col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3"
grid_cls = f"{g.folder}/{g.id}.png"
image_path if os.path.exists(image_path):
return Div(Card(
=image_path, alt="Card image", cls="card-img-top"),
Img(src"Prompt: "), g.prompt, cls="card-text"),cls="card-body"),
Div(P(B(id=f'gen-{g.id}', cls=grid_cls)
), return Div(f"Generating gen {g.id} with prompt {g.prompt}",
id=f'gen-{g.id}', hx_get=f"/gens/{g.id}",
="every 2s", hx_swap="outerHTML", cls=grid_cls) hx_trigger
You can see the final result in main.py in the image_app_simple
example directory, along with info on deploying it (tl;dr don’t!). We’ve also deployed a version that only shows your generations (tied to browser session) and has a credit system to save our bank accounts. You can access that here. Now for the next question: how do we keep track of different users?
Again, with Sessions
At the moment everyone sees all images! How do we keep some sort of unique identifier tied to a user? Before going all the way to setting up users, login pages etc., let’s look at a way to at least limit generations to the user’s session. You could do this manually with cookies. For convenience and security, fasthtml (via Starlette) has a special mechanism for storing small amounts of data in the user’s browser via the session
argument to your route. This acts like a dictionary and you can set and get values from it. For example, here we look for a session_id
key, and if it doesn’t exist we generate a new one:
@app.get("/")
def get(session):
if 'session_id' not in session: session['session_id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
return H1(f"Session ID: {session['session_id']}")
Refresh the page a few times - you’ll notice that the session ID remains the same. If you clear your browsing data, you’ll get a new session ID. And if you load the page in a different browser (but not a different tab), you’ll get a new session ID. This will persist within the current browser, letting us use it as a key for our generations. As a bonus, someone can’t spoof this session id by passing it in another way (for example, sending a query parameter). Behind the scenes, the data is stored in a browser cookie but it is signed with a secret key that stops the user or anyone nefarious from being able to tamper with it. The cookie is decoded back into a dictionary by something called a middleware function, which we won’t cover here. All you need to know is that we can use this to store bits of state in the user’s browser.
In the image app example, we can add a session_id
column to our database, and modify our homepage like so:
@app.get("/")
def get(session):
if 'session_id' not in session: session['session_id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
= Input(id="new-prompt", name="prompt", placeholder="Enter a prompt")
inp = Form(Group(inp, Button("Generate")), hx_post="/", target_id='gen-list', hx_swap="afterbegin")
add = [generation_preview(g) for g in gens(limit=10, where=f"session_id == '{session['session_id']}'")]
gen_containers ...
So we check if the session id exists in the session, add one if not, and then limit the generations shown to only those tied to this session id. We filter the database with a where clause - see [TODO link Jeremy’s example for a more reliable way to do this]. The only other change we need to make is to store the session id in the database when a generation is made. You can check out this version here. You could instead write this app without relying on a database at all - simply storing the filenames of the generated images in the session, for example. But this more general approach of linking some kind of unique session identifier to users or data in our tables is a useful general pattern for more complex examples.
Again, with Credits!
Generating images with replicate costs money. So next let’s add a pool of credits that get used up whenever anyone generates an image. To recover our lost funds, we’ll also set up a payment system so that generous users can buy more credits for everyone. You could modify this to let users buy credits tied to their session ID, but at that point you risk having angry customers losing their money after wiping their browser history, and should consider setting up proper account management :)
Taking payments with Stripe is intimidating but very doable. Here’s a tutorial that shows the general principle using Flask. As with other popular tasks in the web-dev world, ChatGPT knows a lot about Stripe - but you should exercise extra caution when writing code that handles money!
For the finished example we add the bare minimum:
- A way to create a Stripe checkout session and redirect the user to the session URL
- ‘Success’ and ‘Cancel’ routes to handle the result of the checkout
- A route that listens for a webhook from Stripe to update the number of credits when a payment is made.
In a typical application you’ll want to keep track of which users make payments, catch other kinds of stripe events and so on. This example is more a ‘this is possible, do your own research’ than ‘this is how you do it’. But hopefully it does illustrate the key idea: there is no magic here. Stripe (and many other technologies) relies on sending users to different routes and shuttling data back and forth in requests. And we know how to do that!
More on Routing and Request Parameters
There are a number of ways information can be passed to the server. When you specify arguments to a route, FastHTML will search the request for values with the same name, and convert them to the correct type. In order, it searches
- The path parameters
- The query parameters
- The cookies
- The headers
- The session
- Form data
There are also a few special arguments
request
(or any prefix likereq
): gets the raw StarletteRequest
objectsession
(or any prefix likesess
): gets the session objectauth
htmx
app
In this section let’s quickly look at some of these in action.
= FastHTML()
app = TestClient(app) cli
Part of the route (path parameters):
@app.get('/user/{nm}')
def _(nm:str): return f"Good day to you, {nm}!"
'/user/jph').text cli.get(
'Good day to you, jph!'
Matching with a regex:
"imgext", "ico|gif|jpg|jpeg|webm")
reg_re_param(
@app.get(r'/static/{path:path}{fn}.{ext:imgext}')
def get_img(fn:str, path:str, ext:str): return f"Getting {fn}.{ext} from /{path}"
'/static/foo/jph.ico').text cli.get(
'Getting jph.ico from /foo/'
Using an enum (try using a string that isn’t in the enum):
= str_enum('ModelName', "alexnet", "resnet", "lenet")
ModelName
@app.get("/models/{nm}")
def model(nm:ModelName): return nm
print(cli.get('/models/alexnet').text)
alexnet
Casting to a Path:
@app.get("/files/{path}")
def txt(path: Path): return path.with_suffix('.txt')
print(cli.get('/files/foo').text)
foo.txt
An integer with a default value:
= [{"name": "Foo"}, {"name": "Bar"}]
fake_db
@app.get("/items/")
def read_item(idx:int|None = 0): return fake_db[idx]
print(cli.get('/items/?idx=1').text)
{"name":"Bar"}
print(cli.get('/items/').text)
{"name":"Foo"}
Boolean values (takes anything “truthy” or “falsy”):
@app.get("/booly/")
def booly(coming:bool=True): return 'Coming' if coming else 'Not coming'
print(cli.get('/booly/?coming=true').text)
Coming
print(cli.get('/booly/?coming=no').text)
Not coming
Getting dates:
@app.get("/datie/")
def datie(d:date): return d
= "17th of May, 2024, 2p"
date_str print(cli.get(f'/datie/?d={date_str}').text)
2024-05-17 14:00:00
Matching a dataclass:
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
@dataclass
class Bodie:
int;b:str
a:
@app.route("/bodie/{nm}")
def post(nm:str, data:Bodie):
= asdict(data)
res 'nm'] = nm
res[return res
'/bodie/me', data=dict(a=1, b='foo')).text cli.post(
'{"a":1,"b":"foo","nm":"me"}'
User Agent and HX-Request
An argument of user_agent
will match the header User-Agent
. This holds for special headers like HX-Request
(used by HTMX to signal when a request comes from an HTMX request) - the general pattern is that “-” is replaced with “_” and strings are turned to lowercase.
@app.get("/ua")
async def ua(user_agent:str): return user_agent
'/ua', headers={'User-Agent':'FastHTML'}).text cli.get(
'FastHTML'
@app.get("/hxtest")
def hxtest(htmx): return htmx.request
'/hxtest', headers={'HX-Request':'1'}).text cli.get(
'1'
Starlette Requests
If you add an argument called request
(or any prefix of that, for example req
) it will be populated with the Starlette Request
object. This is useful if you want to do your own processing manually. For example, although FastHTML will parse forms for you, you could instead get form data like so:
@app.get("/form")
async def form(request:Request):
= await request.form()
form_data = form_data.get('a') a
See the Starlette docs for more information on the Request
object.
Starlette Responses
You can return a Starlette Response object from a route to control the response. For example:
@app.get("/redirect")
def redirect():
return RedirectResponse(url="/")
We used this to set cookies in the previous example. See the Starlette docs for more information on the Response
object.
Static Files
We often want to serve static files like images. This is easily done! For common file types (images, CSS etc) we can create a route that returns a Starlette FileResponse
like so:
# For images, CSS, etc.
@app.get("/{fname:path}.{ext:static}")
def static(fname: str, ext: str):
return FileResponse(f'{fname}.{ext}')
You can customize it to suit your needs (for example, only serving files in a certain directory). You’ll notice some variant of this route in all our complete examples - even for apps with no static files the browser will typically request a /favicon.ico
file, for example, and as the astute among you will have noticed this has sparked a bit of competition between Johno and Jeremy regarding which country flag should serve as the default!
WebSockets
For certain applications such as multiplayer games, websockets can be a powerful feature. Luckily HTMX and FastHTML has you covered! Simply specify that you wish to include the websocket header extension from HTMX:
= FastHTML(ws_hdr=True)
app = app.route rt
With that, you are now able to specify the different websocket specific HTMX goodies. For example, say we have a website we want to setup a websocket, you can simply:
def mk_inp(): return Input(id='msg')
@rt('/')
async def get(request):
= Div(
cts id='notifications'),
Div(id='form', ws_send=True),
Form(mk_inp(), ='ws', ws_connect='/ws')
hx_extreturn Titled('Websocket Test', cts)
And this will setup a connection on the route /ws
along with a form that will send a message to the websocket whenever the form is submitted. Let’s go ahead and handle this route:
@app.ws('/ws')
async def ws(msg:str, send):
await send(Div('Hello ' + msg, id="notifications"))
await sleep(2)
return Div('Goodbye ' + msg, id="notifications"), mk_inp()
One thing you might have noticed is a lack of target id for our websocket trigger for swapping HTML content. This is because HTMX always swaps content with websockets with Out of Band Swaps. Therefore, HTMX will look for the id in the returned HTML content from the server for determining what to swap. To send stuff to the client, you can either use the send
parameter or simply return the content or both!
Now, sometimes you might want to perform actions when a client connects or disconnects such as add or remove a user from a player queue. To hook into these events, you can pass your connection or disconnection function to the app.ws
decorator:
async def on_connect(send):
print('Connected!')
await send(Div('Hello, you have connected', id="notifications"))
async def on_disconnect(ws):
print('Disconnected!')
@app.ws('/ws', conn=on_connect, disconn=on_disconnect)
async def ws(msg:str, send):
await send(Div('Hello ' + msg, id="notifications"))
await sleep(2)
return Div('Goodbye ' + msg, id="notifications"), mk_inp()
Full Example #3 - Chatbot Example with DaisyUI Components
Let’s go back to the topic of adding components or styling beyond the simple PicoCSS examples so far. How might we adopt a component or framework? In this example, let’s build a chatbot UI leveraging the DaisyUI chat bubble. The final result will look like this:
At first glance, DaisyUI’s chat component looks quite intimidating. The examples look like this:
<div class="chat chat-start">
<div class="chat-image avatar">
<div class="w-10 rounded-full">
<img alt="Tailwind CSS chat bubble component" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb.jpg" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="chat-header">
Obi-Wan Kenobi<time class="text-xs opacity-50">12:45</time>
</div>
<div class="chat-bubble">You were the Chosen One!</div>
<div class="chat-footer opacity-50">
Delivered</div>
</div>
<div class="chat chat-end">
<div class="chat-image avatar">
<div class="w-10 rounded-full">
<img alt="Tailwind CSS chat bubble component" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb.jpg" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="chat-header">
Anakin<time class="text-xs opacity-50">12:46</time>
</div>
<div class="chat-bubble">I hate you!</div>
<div class="chat-footer opacity-50">
Seen at 12:46</div>
</div>
We have several things going for us however.
- ChatGPT knows DaisyUI and Tailwind (DaisyUI is a Tailwind component library)
- We can build things up piece by piece with AI standing by to help.
https://h2x.answer.ai/ is a tool that can convert HTML to FT (fastcore.xml) and back, which is useful for getting a quick starting point when you have an HTML example to start from.
We can strip out some unnecessary bits and try to get the simplest possible example working in a notebook first:
# Loading tailwind and daisyui
= (Script(src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"),
headers ="stylesheet", href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/[email protected]/dist/full.min.css"))
Link(rel
# Displaying a single message
= Div(
d "Chat header here", cls="chat-header"),
Div("My message goes here", cls="chat-bubble chat-bubble-primary"),
Div(="chat chat-start"
cls
)# show(Html(*headers, d)) # uncomment to view
Now we can extend this to render multiple messages, with the message being on the left (chat-start
) or right (chat-end
) depending on the role. While we’re at it, we can also change the color (chat-bubble-primary
) of the message and put them all in a chat-box
div:
= [
messages "role":"user", "content":"Hello"},
{"role":"assistant", "content":"Hi, how can I assist you?"}
{
]
def ChatMessage(msg):
return Div(
'role'], cls="chat-header"),
Div(msg['content'], cls=f"chat-bubble chat-bubble-{'primary' if msg['role'] == 'user' else 'secondary'}"),
Div(msg[=f"chat chat-{'end' if msg['role'] == 'user' else 'start'}")
cls
= Div(*[ChatMessage(msg) for msg in messages], cls="chat-box", id="chatlist")
chatbox
# show(Html(*headers, chatbox)) # Uncomment to view
Next, it was back to the ChatGPT to tweak the chat box so it wouldn’t grow as messages were added. I asked:
"I have something like this (it's working now)
[code]
The messages are added to this div so it grows over time.
Is there a way I can set it's height to always be 80% of the total window height with a scroll bar if needed?"
Based on this query GPT4o helpfully shared that “This can be achieved using Tailwind CSS utility classes. Specifically, you can use h-[80vh] to set the height to 80% of the viewport height, and overflow-y-auto to add a vertical scroll bar when needed.”
To put it another way: none of the CSS classes in the following example were written by a human, and what edits I did make were informed by advice from the AI that made it relatively painless!
The actual chat functionality of the app is based on our claudette library. As with the image example, we face a potential hiccup in that getting a response from an LLM is slow. We need a way to have the user message added to the UI immediately, and then have the response added once it’s available. We could do something similar to the image generation example above, or use websockets. Check out the full example for implementations of both, along with further details.
Full Example #4 - Multiplayer Game of Life Example with Websockets
Let’s see how we can implement a collaborative website using Websockets in FastHTML. To showcase this, we will use the famous Conway’s Game of Life, which is a game that takes place in a grid world. Each cell in the grid can be either alive or dead. The cell’s state is initially given by a user before the game is started and then evolves through the iteration of the grid world once the clock starts. Whether a cell’s state will change from the previous state depends on simple rules based on its neighboring cells’ states. Here is the standard Game of Life logic implemented in Python courtesy of ChatGPT:
= [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]
grid def update_grid(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
= [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]
new_grid def count_neighbors(x, y):
= [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
directions = 0
count for dx, dy in directions:
= x + dx, y + dy
nx, ny if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]): count += grid[nx][ny]
return count
for i in range(len(grid)):
for j in range(len(grid[0])):
= count_neighbors(i, j)
neighbors if grid[i][j] == 1:
if neighbors < 2 or neighbors > 3: new_grid[i][j] = 0
else: new_grid[i][j] = 1
elif neighbors == 3: new_grid[i][j] = 1
return new_grid
This would be a very dull game if we were to run it, since the initial state of everything would remain dead. Therefore, we need a way of letting the user give an initial state before starting the game. FastHTML to the rescue!
def Grid():
= []
cells for y, row in enumerate(game_state['grid']):
for x, cell in enumerate(row):
= 'alive' if cell else 'dead'
cell_class = Div(cls=f'cell {cell_class}', hx_put='/update', hx_vals={'x': x, 'y': y}, hx_swap='none', hx_target='#gol', hx_trigger='click')
cell
cells.append(cell)return Div(*cells, id='grid')
@rt('/update')
async def put(x: int, y: int):
= 1 if grid[y][x] == 0 else 0 grid[y][x]
Above is a component for representing the game’s state that the user can interact with and update on the server using cool HTMX features such as hx_vals
for determining which cell was clicked to make it dead or alive. Now, you probably noticed that the HTTP request in this case is a PUT request, which does not return anything and this means our client’s view of the grid world and the server’s game state will immediately become out of sync :(. We could of course just return a new Grid component with the updated state, but that would only work for a single client, if we had more, they quickly get out of sync with each other and the server. Now Websockets to the rescue!
Websockets are a way for the server to keep a persistent connection with clients and send data to the client without explicitly being requested for information, which is not possible with HTTP. Luckily FastHTML and HTMX work well with Websockets. Simply state you wish to use websockets for your app and define a websocket route:
...= FastHTML(hdrs=(picolink, gridlink, css, htmx_ws), ws_hdr=True)
app
= []
player_queue async def update_players():
for i, player in enumerate(player_queue):
try: await player(Grid())
except: player_queue.pop(i)
async def on_connect(send): player_queue.append(send)
async def on_disconnect(send): await update_players()
@app.ws('/gol', conn=on_connect, disconn=on_disconnect)
async def ws(msg:str, send): pass
def Home(): return Title('Game of Life'), Main(gol, Div(Grid(), id='gol', cls='row center-xs'), hx_ext="ws", ws_connect="/gol")
@rt('/update')
async def put(x: int, y: int):
= 1 if grid[y][x] == 0 else 0
grid[y][x] await update_players()
...
Here we simply keep track of all the players that have connected or disconnected to our site and when an update occurs, we send updates to all the players still connected via websockets. Via HTMX, you are still simply exchanging HTML from the server to the client and will swap in the content based on how you setup your hx_swap
attribute. There is only one difference, that being all swaps are OOB. You can find more information on the HTMX websocket extension documentation page here. You can find a full fledge hosted example of this app here.
FT objects and HTML
These FT objects create a ‘FastTag’ structure [tag,children,attrs] for toxml()
. When we call Div(...)
, the elements we pass in are the children. Attributes are passed in as keywords. class
and for
are special words in python, so we use cls
, klass
or _class
instead of class
and fr
or _for
instead of for
. Note these objects are just 3-element lists - you can create custom ones too as long as they’re also 3-element lists. Alternately, leaf nodes can be strings instead (which is why you can do Div('some text')
). If you pass something that isn’t a 3-element list or a string, it will be converted to a string using str()… unless (our final trick) you define a __ft__
method that will run before str(), so you can render things a custom way.
For example, here’s one way we could make a custom class that can be rendered into HTML:
class Person:
def __init__(self, name, age):
self.name = name
self.age = age
def __ft__(self):
return ['div', [f'{self.name} is {self.age} years old.'], {}]
= Person('Jonathan', 28)
p print(to_xml(Div(p, "more text", cls="container")))
<div class="container">
<div>Jonathan is 28 years old.</div>
more text
</div>
In the examples, you’ll see we often patch in __ft__
methods to existing classes to control how they’re rendered. For example, if Person didn’t have a __ft__
method or we wanted to override it, we could add a new one like this:
from fastcore.all import patch
@patch
def __ft__(self:Person):
return Div("Person info:", Ul(Li("Name:",self.name), Li("Age:", self.age)))
show(p)
- Name: Jonathan
- Age: 28
Some tags from fastcore.xml are overwritten by fasthtml.core and a few are further extended by fasthtml.xtend using this method. Over time, we hope to see others developing custom components too, giving us a larger and larger ecosystem of reusable components.
Custom Scripts and Styling
There are many popular JavaScript and CSS libraries that can be used via a simple Script
or Style
tag. But in some cases you will need to write more custom code. FastHTML’s js.py contains a few examples that may be useful as reference.
For example, to use the marked.js library to render markdown in a div, including in components added after the page has loaded via htmx, we do something like this:
import { marked } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/lib/marked.esm.js";
import { proc_htmx} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/answerdotai/fasthtml-js/fasthtml.js";
proc_htmx('%s', e => e.innerHTML = marked.parse(e.textContent));
proc_htmx
is a shortcut that we wrote to apply a function to elements matching a selector, including the element that triggered the event. Here’s the code for reference:
export function proc_htmx(sel, func) {
.onLoad(elt => {
htmxconst elements = htmx.findAll(elt, sel);
if (elt.matches(sel)) elements.unshift(elt)
.forEach(func);
elements;
}) }
The AI Pictionary example uses a larger chunk of custom JavaScript to handle the drawing canvas. It’s a good example of the type of application where running code on the client side makes the most sense, but still shows how you can integrate it with FastHTML on the server side to add functionality (like the AI responses) easily.
Adding styling with custom CSS and libraries such as tailwind is done the same way we add custom JavaScript. The doodle example uses Doodle.CSS to style the page in a quirky way.
Deploying Your App
We can deploy FastHTML almost anywhere you can deploy python apps. We’ve tested Railway, Replit, HuggingFace, and PythonAnywhere.
Railway
- Install the Railway CLI and sign up for an account.
- Set up a folder with our app as
main.py
- In the folder, run
railway login
. - Use the
fh_railway_deploy
script to deploy our project:
fh_railway_deploy MY_APP_NAME
What the script does for us:
- Do we have an existing railway project?
- Yes: Link the project folder to our existing Railway project.
- No: Create a new Railway project.
- Deploy the project. We’ll see the logs as the service is built and run!
- Fetches and displays the URL of our app.
- By default, mounts a
/app/data
folder on the cloud to our app’s root folder. The app is run in/app
by default, so from our app anything we store in/data
will persist across restarts.
A final note about Railway: We can add secrets like API keys that can be accessed as environment variables from our apps via ‘Variables’. For example, for the image app (TODO link), we can add a REPLICATE_API_KEY
variable, and then in main.py
we can access it as os.environ['REPLICATE_API_KEY']
.
Replit
Fork this repl for a minimal example you can edit to your heart’s content. .replit
has been edited to add the right run command (run = ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--reload"]
) and to set up the ports correctly. FastHTML was installed with poetry add python-fasthtml
, you can add additional packages as needed in the same way. Running the app in Replit will show you a webview, but you may need to open in a new tab for all features (such as cookies) to work. When you’re ready, you can deploy your app by clicking the ‘Deploy’ button. You pay for usage - for an app that is mostly idle the cost is usually a few cents per month.
You can store secrets like API keys via the ‘Secrets’ tab in the Replit project settings.
HuggingFace
Follow the instructions in this repository to deploy to HuggingFace spaces.
Where Next?
We’ve covered a lot of ground here! Hopefully this has given you plenty to work with in building your own FastHTML apps. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #fasthtml Discord channel (in the fastai Discord community). You can look through the other examples in the fasthtml-example repository for more ideas, and keep an eye on Jeremy’s YouTube channel where we’ll be releasing a number of “dev chats” related to FastHTML in the near future.We import what we need for rapid development! A carefully-curated set of FastHTML functions and other Python objects is brought into our global namespace for convenience.
2
We instantiate a FastHTML app with the fast_app() utility function. This provides a number of really useful defaults that we’ll take advantage of later in the tutorial.
3
We use the rt() decorator to tell FastHTML what to return when a user visits / in their browser.
4
We connect this route to HTTP GET requests by defining a view function called get().
5
A tree of Python function calls that return all the HTML required to write a properly formed web page. You’ll soon see the power of this approach.
6
The serve() utility configures and runs FastHTML using a library called uvicorn.
Run the code:
python main.py
The terminal will look like this:
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)INFO: Started reloader process [58058] using WatchFilesINFO: Started server process [58060]INFO: Waiting for application startup.INFO: Application startup complete.
Confirm FastHTML is running by opening your web browser to 127.0.0.1:5001. You should see something like the image below:
Note
While some linters and developers will complain about the wildcard import, it is by design here and perfectly safe. FastHTML is very deliberate about the objects it exports in fasthtml.common. If it bothers you, you can import the objects you need individually, though it will make the code more verbose and less readable.
If you want to learn more about how FastHTML handles imports, we cover that here.
A Minimal Charting Application
The Script function allows you to include JavaScript. You can use Python to generate parts of your JS or JSON like this:
When we can’t figure out a bug in FastHTML, we can run it in DEBUG mode. When an error is thrown, the error screen is displayed in the browser. This error setting should never be used in a deployed app.
Python throws an error when it tries to divide an integer by zero.
Routing
FastHTML builds upon FastAPI’s friendly decorator pattern for specifying URLs, with extra features:
main.py
from fasthtml.common import*app, rt = fast_app()1@rt("/")def get():return Titled("FastHTML", P("Let's do this!"))2@rt("/hello")def get():return Titled("Hello, world!")serve()
1
The “/” URL on line 5 is the home of a project. This would be accessed at 127.0.0.1:5001.
2
“/hello” URL on line 9 will be found by the project if the user visits 127.0.0.1:5001/hello.
Tip
It looks like get() is being defined twice, but that’s not the case. Each function decorated with rt is totally separate, and is injected into the router. We’re not calling them in the module’s namespace (locals()). Rather, we’re loading them into the routing mechanism using the rt decorator.
You can do more! Read on to learn what we can do to make parts of the URL dynamic.
Variables in URLs
You can add variable sections to a URL by marking them with {variable_name}. Your function then receives the {variable_name} as a keyword argument, but only if it is the correct type. Here’s an example:
main.py
from fasthtml.common import*app, rt = fast_app()1@rt("/{name}/{age}")2def get(name: str, age: int):3return Titled(f"Hello {name.title()}, age {age}")serve()
1
We specify two variable names, name and age.
2
We define two function arguments named identically to the variables. You will note that we specify the Python types to be passed.
3
We use these functions in our project.
Try it out by going to this address: 127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5. You should get a page that says,
“Hello Uma, age 5”.
What happens if we enter incorrect data?
The 127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5 URL works because 5 is an integer. If we enter something that is not, such as 127.0.0.1:5001/uma/five, then FastHTML will return an error instead of a web page.
FastHTML URL routing supports more complex types
The two examples we provide here use Python’s built-in str and int types, but you can use your own types, including more complex ones such as those defined by libraries like attrs, pydantic, and even sqlmodel.
HTTP Methods
FastHTML matches function names to HTTP methods. So far the URL routes we’ve defined have been for HTTP GET methods, the most common method for web pages.
Form submissions often are sent as HTTP POST. When dealing with more dynamic web page designs, also known as Single Page Apps (SPA for short), the need can arise for other methods such as HTTP PUT and HTTP DELETE. The way FastHTML handles this is by changing the function name.
By setting pico to False, FastHTML will not include pico.min.css.
2
This will generate an HTML <link> tag for sourcing the css for Sakura.
3
If you want an inline styles, the Style() function will put the result into the HTML.
Other Static Media File Locations
As you saw, Script and Link are specific to the most common static media use cases in web apps: including JavaScript, CSS, and images. But it also works with videos and other static media files. The default behavior is to look for these files in the root directory - typically we don’t do anything special to include them.
FastHTML also allows us to define a route that uses FileResponse to serve the file at a specified path. This is useful for serving images, videos, and other media files from a different directory without having to change the paths of many files. So if we move the directory containing the media files, we only need to change the path in one place. In the example below, we call images from a directory called public.
from fasthtml.common import*hdrs = (MarkdownJS(), HighlightJS(langs=['python', 'javascript', 'html', 'css']), )app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)content ="""Here are some _markdown_ elements.- This is a list item- This is another list item- And this is a third list item**Fenced code blocks work here.**"""@rt('/')def get(req):return Titled("Markdown rendering example", Div(content,cls="marked"))serve()
Code highlighting
Here’s how to highlight code without any markdown configuration.
from fasthtml.common import*# Add the HighlightJS built-in headerhdrs = (HighlightJS(langs=['python', 'javascript', 'html', 'css']),)app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)code_example ="""import datetimeimport timefor i in range(10): print(f"{datetime.datetime.now()}") time.sleep(1)"""@rt('/')def get(req):return Titled("Markdown rendering example", Div(# The code example needs to be surrounded by# Pre & Code elements Pre(Code(code_example)) ))serve()
Defining new ft components
We can build our own ft components and combine them with other components. The simplest method is defining them as a function.
def hero(title, statement):return Div(H1(title),P(statement), cls="hero")# usage exampleMain( hero("Hello World", "This is a hero statement"))
<main><div class="hero"><h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a hero statement</p></div></main>
Pass through components
For when we need to define a new component that allows zero-to-many components to be nested within them, we lean on Python’s *args and **kwargs mechanism. Useful for creating page layout controls.
def layout(*args, **kwargs):"""Dashboard layout for all our dashboard views"""return Main( H1("Dashboard"), Div(*args, **kwargs), cls="dashboard", )# usage examplelayout( Ul(*[Li(o) for o inrange(3)]), P("Some content", cls="description"),)
While functions are easy to read, for more complex components some might find it easier to use a dataclass.
from dataclasses import dataclass@dataclassclass Hero: title: str statement: strdef __ft__(self):""" The __ft__ method renders the dataclass at runtime."""return Div(H1(self.title),P(self.statement), cls="hero")# usage exampleMain( Hero("Hello World", "This is a hero statement"))
<main><div class="hero"><h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a hero statement</p></div></main>
Testing views in notebooks
Because of the ASGI event loop it is currently impossible to run FastHTML inside a notebook. However, we can still test the output of our views. To do this, we leverage Starlette, an ASGI toolkit that FastHTML uses.
# First we instantiate our app, in this case we remove the# default headers to reduce the size of the output.app, rt = fast_app(default_hdrs=False)# Setting up the Starlette test clientfrom starlette.testclient import TestClientclient = TestClient(app)# Usage example@rt("/")def get():return Titled("FastHTML is awesome", P("The fastest way to create web apps in Python"))print(client.get("/").text)
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>FastHTML is awesome</title>
</head>
<body>
<main class="container">
<h1>FastHTML is awesome</h1>
<p>The fastest way to create web apps in Python</p>
</main>
</body>
</html>
Strings and conversion order
The general rules for rendering are: - __ft__ method will be called (for default components like P, H2, etc. or if you define your own components) - If you pass a string, it will be escaped - On other python objects, str() will be called
As a consequence, if you want to include plain HTML tags directly into e.g. a Div() they will get escaped by default (as a security measure to avoid code injections). This can be avoided by using NotStr(), a convenient way to reuse python code that returns already HTML. If you use pandas, you can use pandas.DataFrame.to_html() to get a nice table. To include the output a FastHTML, wrap it in NotStr(), like Div(NotStr(df.to_html())).
Above we saw how a dataclass behaves with the __ft__ method defined. On a plain dataclass, str() will be called (but not escaped).
from dataclasses import dataclass@dataclassclass Hero: title: str statement: str# rendering the dataclass with the default methodMain( Hero("<h1>Hello World</h1>", "This is a hero statement"))
<main>Hero(title='<h1>Hello World</h1>', statement='This is a hero statement')</main>
# This will display the HTML as text on your pageDiv("Let's include some HTML here: <div>Some HTML</div>")
<div>Let's include some HTML here: <div>Some HTML</div></div>
# Keep the string untouched, will be rendered on the pageDiv(NotStr("<div><h1>Some HTML</h1></div>"))
<div><div><h1>Some HTML</h1></div></div>
Custom exception handlers
FastHTML allows customization of exception handlers, but does so gracefully. What this means is by default it includes all the <html> tags needed to display attractive content. Try it out!
from fasthtml.common import*def not_found(req, exc): return Titled("404: I don't exist!")exception_handlers = {404: not_found}app, rt = fast_app(exception_handlers=exception_handlers)@rt('/')def get():return (Titled("Home page", P(A(href="/oops")("Click to generate 404 error"))))serve()
We can also use lambda to make things more terse:
from fasthtml.common import*exception_handlers={404: lambda req, exc: Titled("404: I don't exist!"),418: lambda req, exc: Titled("418: I'm a teapot!")}app, rt = fast_app(exception_handlers=exception_handlers)@rt('/')def get():return (Titled("Home page", P(A(href="/oops")("Click to generate 404 error"))))serve()
Cookies
We can set cookies using the cookie() function. In our example, we’ll create a timestamp cookie.
from datetime import datetimefrom IPython.display import HTML
@rt("/settimestamp")def get(req): now = datetime.now()return P(f'Set to {now}'), cookie('now', datetime.now())HTML(client.get('/settimestamp').text)
FastHTML page
Set to 2024-08-07 09:07:47.535449
Now let’s get it back using the same name for our parameter as the cookie name.
@rt('/gettimestamp')def get(now:date): returnf'Cookie was set at time {now.time()}'client.get('/gettimestamp').text
'Cookie was set at time 09:07:47.535456'
Sessions
For convenience and security, FastHTML has a mechanism for storing small amounts of data in the user’s browser. We can do this by adding a session argument to routes. FastHTML sessions are Python dictionaries, and we can leverage to our benefit. The example below shows how to concisely set and get sessions.
@rt('/adder/{num}')def get(session, num: int): session.setdefault('sum', 0) session['sum'] = session.get('sum') + numreturn Response(f'The sum is {session["sum"]}.')
Toasts (also known as Messages)
Toasts, sometimes called “Messages” are small notifications usually in colored boxes used to notify users that something has happened. Toasts can be of four types:
info
success
warning
error
Examples toasts might include:
“Payment accepted”
“Data submitted”
“Request approved”
Toasts take a little configuration plus views that use them require the session argument.
1setup_toasts(app)@rt('/toasting')2def get(session):# Normally one toast is enough, this allows us to see# different toast types in action. add_toast(session, f"Toast is being cooked", "info") add_toast(session, f"Toast is ready", "success") add_toast(session, f"Toast is getting a bit crispy", "warning") add_toast(session, f"Toast is burning!", "error")return Titled("I like toast")
1
setup_toasts is a helper function that adds toast dependencies. Usually this would be declared right after fast_app().
2
Toasts require sessions.
Authentication and authorization
In FastHTML the tasks of authentication and authorization are handled with Beforeware. Beforeware are functions that run before the route handler is called. They are useful for global tasks like ensuring users are authenticated or have permissions to access a view.
First, we write a function that accepts a request and session arguments:
# Status code 303 is a redirect that can change POST to GET,# so it's appropriate for a login page.login_redir = RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)def user_auth_before(req, sess):# The `auth` key in the request scope is automatically provided# to any handler which requests it, and can not be injected# by the user using query params, cookies, etc, so it should# be secure to use. auth = req.scope['auth'] = sess.get('auth', None)# If the session key is not there, it redirects to the login page.ifnot auth: return login_redir
Now we pass our user_auth_before function as the first argument into a Beforeware class. We also pass a list of regular expressions to the skip argument, designed to allow users to still get to the home and login pages.head

Welcome to the official FastHTML documentation.
FastHTML is a new next-generation web framework for fast, scalable web applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:
- Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced, interactive web apps you can imagine.
- Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more done.
- Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy to build complex apps quickly.
FastHTML apps are just Python code, so you can use FastHTML with the full power of the Python language and ecosystem. FastHTML’s functionality maps 1:1 directly to HTML and HTTP, but allows them to be encapsulated using good software engineering practices—so you’ll need to understand these foundations to use this library fully. To understand how and why this works, please read this first: about.fastht.ml.
Installation
Since fasthtml
is a Python library, you can install it with:
pip install python-fasthtml
In the near future, we hope to add component libraries that can likewise be installed via pip
.
Usage
For a minimal app, create a file “main.py” as follows:
main.py
from fasthtml.common import *
= fast_app()
app,rt
@rt('/')
def get(): return Div(P('Hello World!'), hx_get="/change")
serve()
Running the app with python main.py
prints out a link to your running app: http://localhost:5001
. Visit that link in your browser and you should see a page with the text “Hello World!”. Congratulations, you’ve just created your first FastHTML app!
Adding interactivity is surprisingly easy, thanks to HTMX. Modify the file to add this function:
main.py
@rt('/change')
def get(): return P('Nice to be here!')
You now have a page with a clickable element that changes the text when clicked. When clicking on this link, the server will respond with an “HTML partial”—that is, just a snippet of HTML which will be inserted into the existing page. In this case, the returned element will replace the original P element (since that’s the default behavior of HTMX) with the new version returned by the second route.
This “hypermedia-based” approach to web development is a powerful way to build web applications.

BYO Blog
This document is a work in progress.
In this tutorial we’re going to write a blog by example. Blogs are a good way to learn a web framework as they start simple yet can get surprisingly sophistated. The wikipedia definition of a blog is “an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts) informal diary-style text entries (posts)”, which means we need to provide these basic features:
- A list of articles
- A means to create/edit/delete the articles
- An attractive but accessible layout
We’ll also add in these features, so the blog can become a working site:
- RSS feed
- Pages independent of the list of articles (about and contact come to mind)
- Import and Export of articles
- Tagging and categorization of data
- Deployment
- Ability to scale for large volumes of readers
How to best use this tutorial
We could copy/paste every code example in sequence and have a finished blog at the end. However, it’s debatable how much we will learn through the copy/paste method. We’re not saying its impossible to learn through copy/paste, we’re just saying it’s not that of an efficient way to learn. It’s analogous to learning how to play a musical instrument or sport or video game by watching other people do it - you can learn some but its not the same as doing.
A better approach is to type out every line of code in this tutorial. This forces us to run the code through our brains, giving us actual practice in how to write FastHTML and Pythoncode and forcing us to debug our own mistakes. In some cases we’ll repeat similar tasks - a key component in achieving mastery in anything. Coming back to the instrument/sport/video game analogy, it’s exactly like actually practicing an instrument, sport, or video game. Through practice and repetition we eventually achieve mastery.
Installing FastHTML
FastHTML is just Python. Installation is often done with pip:
pip install python-fasthtml
A minimal FastHTML app
First, create the directory for our project using Python’s pathlib module:
import pathlib
'blog-system').mkdir() pathlib.Path(
Now that we have our directory, let’s create a minimal FastHTML site in it.
blog-system/minimal.py
from fasthtml.common import *
= fast_app()
app, rt
@rt("/")
def get():
return Titled("FastHTML", P("Let's do this!"))
serve()
Run that with python minimal.py
and you should get something like this:
python minimal.py
Link: http://localhost:5001
INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/Users/pydanny/projects/blog-system']
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO: Started reloader process [46572] using WatchFiles
INFO: Started server process [46576]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
Confirm FastHTML is running by opening your web browser to 127.0.0.1:5001. You should see something like the image below:
import *
?
For those worried about the use of import *
rather than a PEP8-style declared namespace, understand that __all__
is defined in FastHTML’s common module. That means that only the symbols (functions, classes, and other things) the framework wants us to have will be brought into our own code via import *
. Read importing from a package) for more information.
Nevertheless, if we want to use a defined namespace we can do so. Here’s an example:
from fasthtml import common as fh
= fh.fast_app()
app, rt
@rt("/")
def get():
return fh.Titled("FastHTML", fh.P("Let's do this!"))
fh.serve()
Looking more closely at our app
Let’s look more closely at our application. Every line is packed with powerful features of FastHTML:
blog-system/minimal.py
- 1
- The top level namespace of Fast HTML (fasthtml.common) contains everything we need from FastHTML to build applications. A carefully-curated set of FastHTML functions and other Python objects is brought into our global namespace for convenience.
- 2
-
We instantiate a FastHTML app with the
fast_app()
utility function. This provides a number of really useful defaults that we’ll modify or take advantage of later in the tutorial. - 3
-
We use the
rt()
decorator to tell FastHTML what to return when a user visits/
in their browser. - 4
-
We connect this route to HTTP GET requests by defining a view function called
get()
. - 5
- A tree of Python function calls that return all the HTML required to write a properly formed web page. You’ll soon see the power of this approach.
- 6
-
The
serve()
utility configures and runs FastHTML using a library calleduvicorn
. Any changes to this module will be reloaded into the browser.
Adding dynamic content to our minimal app
Our page is great, but we’ll make it better. Let’s add a randomized list of letters to the page. Every time the page reloads, a new list of varying length will be generated.
blog-system/random_letters.py
- 1
-
The
string
andrandom
libraries are part of Python’s standard library - 2
-
We use these libraries to generate a random length list of random letters called
letters
- 3
-
Using
letters
as the base we use list comprehension to generate a list ofLi
ft display components, each with their own letter and save that to the variableitems
- 4
-
Inside a call to the
Ul()
ft component we use Python’s*args
special syntax on theitems
variable. Therefore*list
is treated not as one argument but rather a set of them.
When this is run, it will generate something like this with a different random list of letters for each page load:
Storing the articles
The most basic component of a blog is a series of articles sorted by date authored. Rather than a database we’re going to use our computer’s harddrive to store a set of markdown files in a directory within our blog called posts
. First, let’s create the directory and some test files we can use to search for:
Searching for these files can be done with pathlib.
import pathlib
for filename in pathlib.Path("posts").rglob("*.md"):
print(filename)
posts/article_5.md
posts/article_1.md
posts/article_0.md
posts/article_4.md
posts/article_3.md
posts/article_7.md
posts/article_6.md
posts/article_2.md
posts/article_9.md
posts/article_8.md
Python’s pathlib library is quite useful and makes file search and manipulation much easier. There’s many uses for it and is compatible across operating systems.
Creating the blog home page
We now have enough tools that we can create the home page. Let’s create a new Python file and write out our simple view to list the articles in our blog.from fasthtml.common import NotStr,Div, to_xml
= NotStr('<div></div>')
div_NotStr = Div()
div_ootb
# Proving they generate the same xml
assert to_xml(div_NotStr) == to_xml(div_ootb)
Custom Components
The majority of the time the default ft components are all you need (for example Div
, P
, H1
, etc.).
If you don’t know what an ft component is, you should read the explaining ft components explainer first.
However, there are many situations where you need a custom ft component that creates a unique HTML tag (for example <zero-md></zero-md>
). There are many options in FastHTML to do this, and this section will walk through them. Generally you want to use the highest level option that fits your needs.
This external tutorial walks through a practical situation where you may want to create a custom HTML tag using a custom ft component. Seeing a real-world example is a good way to understand why the contents of this guide is useful.
NotStr
The first way is to use the NotStr
class to use an HTML tag as a string. It works as a one-off but quickly becomes harder to work with as complexity grows. However we can see that you can genenrate the same xml using NotStr
as the out-of-the-box components.
Automatic Creation
The next (and better) approach is to let FastHTML generate the component function for you. As you can see in our assert
this creates a function that creates the HTML just as we wanted. This works even though there is not a Some_never_before_used_tag
function in the fasthtml.components
source code (you can verify this yourself by looking at the source code).
Typically these tags are needed because a CSS or Javascript library created a new XML tag that isn’t default HTML. For example the zero-md
javascript library looks for a <zero-md></zero-md>
tag to know what to run its javascript code on. Most CSS libraries work by creating styling based on the class
attribute, but they can also apply styling to an arbitrary HTML tag that they made up.
from fasthtml.components import Some_never_before_used_tag
Some_never_before_used_tag()
some-never-before-used-tag></some-never-before-used-tag> <
Manual Creation
The automatic creation isn’t magic. It’s just calling a python function __getattr__
and you can call it yourself to get the same result.
import fasthtml
= fasthtml.components.Some_never_before_used_tag()
auto_called = fasthtml.components.__getattr__('Some_never_before_used_tag')()
manual_called
# Proving they generate the same xml
assert to_xml(auto_called) == to_xml(manual_called)
Knowing that, we know that it’s possible to create a different function that has different behavior than FastHTMLs default behavior by modifying how the ___getattr__
function creates the components! It’s only a few lines of code and reading that what it does is a great way to understand components more deeply.
Dunder methods and functions are special functions that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their name. They are called at specific times in python so you can use them to cause customized behavior that makes sense for your specific use case. They can appear magical if you don’t know how python works, but they are extremely commonly used to modify python’s default behavior (__init__
is probably the most common one).
In a module __getattr__
is called to get an attribute. In fasthtml.components
, this is defined to create components automatically for you.
For example if you want a component that creates <path></path>
that doesn’t conflict names with pathlib.Path
you can do that. FastHTML automatically creates new components with a 1:1 mapping and a consistent name, which is almost always what you want. But in some cases you may want to customize that and you can use the ft_hx
function to do that differently than the default.
from fasthtml.common import ft_hx
def ft_path(*c, target_id=None, **kwargs):
return ft_hx('path', *c, target_id=target_id, **kwargs)
ft_path()
path></path> <
We can add any behavior in that function that we need to, so let’s go through some progressively complex examples that you may need in some of your projects.
Symbols (ie @) in tag attributes
It also may be that an argument in an HTML tag uses characters that can’t be used in python arguments. To handle these you can define those args using a dictionary.
='normal stuff',**{'notNormal:arg:with_varing@symbols!':'123'}) Div(normal_arg
<div normal-arg="normal stuff" notnormal:arg:with_varing@symbols!="123"></div>JS App Walkthrough
Installation
You’ll need the following software to complete the tutorial, read on for specific installation instructions:
- Python
- A Python package manager such as pip (which normally comes with Python) or uv
- FastHTML
- Web browser
- Railway.app account
If you haven’t worked with Python before, we recommend getting started with Miniconda.
Note that you will only need to follow the steps in the installation section once per environment. If you create a new repo, you won’t need to redo these.
Install FastHTML
For Mac, Windows and Linux, enter:
pip install python-fasthtml
First steps
By the end of this section you’ll have your own FastHTML website with tests deployed to railway.app.
Create a hello world
Create a new folder to organize all the files for your project. Inside this folder, create a file called main.py
and add the following code to it:
main.py
from fasthtml.common import *
= FastHTML()
app = app.route
rt
@rt('/')
def get():
return 'Hello, world!'
serve()
Finally, run python main.py
in your terminal and open your browser to the ‘Link’ that appears.
QuickDraw: A FastHTML Adventure 🎨✨
The end result of this tutorial will be QuickDraw, a real-time collaborative drawing app using FastHTML. Here is what the final site will look like:
Drawing Rooms
Drawing rooms are the core concept of our application. Each room represents a separate drawing space where a user can let their inner Picasso shine. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
- Room Creation and Storage
main.py
= database('data/drawapp.db')
db = db.t.rooms
rooms if rooms not in db.t:
id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')
rooms.create(= rooms.dataclass()
Room
@patch
def __ft__(self:Room):
return Li(A(self.name, href=f"/rooms/{self.id}"))
Or you can use our fast_app
function to create a FastHTML app with a SQLite database and dataclass in one line:
main.py
def render(room):
return Li(A(room.name, href=f"/rooms/{room.id}"))
= fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id') app,rt,rooms,Room
We are specifying a render function to convert our dataclass into HTML, which is the same as extending the __ft__
method from the patch
decorator we used before. We will use this method for the rest of the tutorial since it is a lot cleaner and easier to read.
- We’re using a SQLite database (via FastLite) to store our rooms.
- Each room has an id (integer), a name (string), and a created_at timestamp (string).
- The Room dataclass is automatically generated based on this structure.
- Creating a room

room.created_at return rooms.insert(room)
- When a user submits the “Create Room” form, this route is called.
- It creates a new Room object, sets the creation time, and inserts it into the database.
- It returns an HTML list item with a link to the new room, which is dynamically added to the room list on the homepage thanks to HTMX.
- Let’s give our rooms shape
main.py
@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
= rooms[id]
room return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}", H1(f"Welcome to {room.name}"), A(Button("Leave Room"), href="/"))
- This route renders the interface for a specific room.
- It fetches the room from the database and renders a title, heading, and paragraph.
Here is the full code so far:
main.py
from fasthtml.common import *
from datetime import datetime
def render(room):
return Li(A(room.name, href=f"/rooms/{room.id}"))
= fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')
app,rt,rooms,Room
@rt("/")
def get():
= Form(Input(id="name", name="name", placeholder="New Room Name"),
create_room "Create Room"),
Button(="/rooms", hx_target="#rooms-list", hx_swap="afterbegin")
hx_post= Ul(*rooms(order_by='id DESC'), id='rooms-list')
rooms_list return Titled("DrawCollab", create_room, rooms_list)
@rt("/rooms")
async def post(room:Room):
= datetime.now().isoformat()
room.created_at return rooms.insert(room)
@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
= rooms[id]
room return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}", H1(f"Welcome to {room.name}"), A(Button("Leave Room"), href="/"))
serve()
Now run python main.py
in your terminal and open your browser to the ‘Link’ that appears. You should see a page with a form to create a new room and a list of existing rooms.
The Canvas - Let’s Get Drawing! 🖌️
Time to add the actual drawing functionality. We’ll use Fabric.js for this:
main.py
# ... (keep the previous imports and database setup)
@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
= rooms[id]
room = Canvas(id="canvas", width="800", height="600")
canvas = Input(type="color", id="color-picker", value="#3CDD8C")
color_picker = Input(type="range", id="brush-size", min="1", max="50", value="10")
brush_size
= """
js var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');
canvas.isDrawingMode = true;
canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = '#3CDD8C';
canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = 10;
document.getElementById('color-picker').onchange = function() {
canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = this.value;
};
document.getElementById('brush-size').oninput = function() {
canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = parseInt(this.value, 10);
};
"""
return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}",
canvas,
Div(color_picker, brush_size),="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fabric.js/5.3.1/fabric.min.js"),
Script(src
Script(js))
# ... (keep the serve() part)
Now we’ve got a drawing canvas! FastHTML makes it easy to include external libraries and add custom JavaScript.
Saving and Loading Canvases 💾
Now that we have a working drawing canvas, let’s add the ability to save and load drawings. We’ll modify our database schema to include a canvas_data
field, and add new routes for saving and loading canvas data. Here’s how we’ll update our code:
- Modify the database schema:
main.py
= fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, canvas_data=str, pk='id') app,rt,rooms,Room
- Add a save button that grabs the canvas’ state and sends it to the server:
main.py
@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
= rooms[id]
room = Canvas(id="canvas", width="800", height="600")
canvas = Input(type="color", id="color-picker", value="#3CDD8C")
color_picker = Input(type="range", id="brush-size", min="1", max="50", value="10")
brush_size = Button("Save Canvas", id="save-canvas", hx_post=f"/rooms/{id}/save", hx_vals="js:{canvas_data: JSON.stringify(canvas.toJSON())}")
save_button # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
- Add routes for saving and loading canvas data:
main.py
@rt("/rooms/{id}/save")
async def post(id:int, canvas_data:str):
'canvas_data': canvas_data}, id)
rooms.update({return "Canvas saved successfully"
@rt("/rooms/{id}/load")
async def get(id:int):
= rooms[id]
room return room.canvas_data if room.canvas_data else "{}"
- Update the JavaScript to load existing canvas data:
main.py
= f"""
js var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');
.isDrawingMode = true;
canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = '#3CDD8C';
canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = 10;
canvas// Load existing canvas data
fetch(`/rooms/{id}/load`)
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {{
if (data && Object.keys(data).length > 0) {{
.loadFromJSON(data, canvas.renderAll.bind(canvas));
canvas
}};
}})
// ... (rest of the JavaScript remains the same)
"""
With these changes, users can now save their drawings and load them when they return to the room. The canvas data is stored as a JSON string in the database, allowing for easy serialization and deserialization. Try it out! Create a new room, make a drawing, save it, and then reload the page. You should see your drawing reappear, ready for further editing.
Here is the completed code:
main.py
from fasthtml.common import *
from datetime import datetime
def render(room):
return Li(A(room.name, href=f"/rooms/{room.id}"))
= fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, canvas_data=str, pk='id')

Deploying to Railway
You can deploy your website to a number of hosting providers, for this tutorial we’ll be using Railway. To get started, make sure you create an account and install the Railway CLI. Once installed, make sure to run railway login
to log in to your account.
To make deploying your website as easy as possible, FastHTMl comes with a built in CLI tool that will handle most of the deployment process for you. To deploy your website, run the following command in your terminal in the root directory of your project:
fh_railway_deploy quickdraw
Your app must be located in a main.py
file for this to work.
Conclusion: You’re a FastHTML Artist Now! 🎨🚀
Congratulations! You’ve just built a sleek, interactive web application using FastHTML. Let’s recap what we’ve learned:
- FastHTML allows you to create dynamic web apps with minimal code.
- We used FastHTML’s routing system to handle different pages and actions.
- We integrated with a SQLite database to store room information and canvas data.
- We utilized Fabric.js to create an interactive drawing canvas.
- We implemented features like color picking, brush size adjustment, and canvas saving.
- We used HTMX for seamless, partial page updates without full reloads.
- We learned how to deploy our FastHTML application to Railway for easy hosting.
You’ve taken your first steps into the world of FastHTML development. From here, the possibilities are endless! You could enhance the drawing app further by adding features like:
- Implementing different drawing tools (e.g., shapes, text)
- Adding user authentication
- Creating a gallery of saved drawings
- Implementing real-time collaborative drawing using WebSockets
Whatever you choose to build next, FastHTML has got your back. Now go forth and create something awesome! Happy coding! 🖼️🚀Command Line Tools

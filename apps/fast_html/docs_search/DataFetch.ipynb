       "'FastHTML\\nWelcome to the official FastHTML documentation.\\nFastHTML is a new next-generation web framework for fast, scalable web applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:\\n- Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced, interactive web apps you can imagine.\\n- Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more done.\\n- Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy to build complex apps quickly.\\nFastHTML apps are just Python code, so you can use FastHTML with the full power of the Python language and ecosystem. FastHTML’s functionality maps 1:1 directly to HTML and HTTP, but allows them to be encapsulated using good software engineering practices—so you’ll need to understand these foundations to use this library fully. To understand how and why this works, please read this first: about.fastht.ml.\\nInstallation\\nSince fasthtml\\nis a Python library, you can install it with:\\npip install python-fasthtml\\nIn the near future, we hope to add component libraries that can likewise be installed via pip\\n.\\nUsage\\nFor a minimal app, create a file “main.py” as follows:\\nmain.py\\nfrom fasthtml.common import *\\n= fast_app()\\napp,rt\\n@rt(\\'/\\')\\ndef get(): return Div(P(\\'Hello World!\\'), hx_get=\"/change\")\\nserve()\\nRunning the app with python main.py\\nprints out a link to your running app: http://localhost:5001\\n. Visit that link in your browser and you should see a page with the text “Hello World!”. Congratulations, you’ve just created your first FastHTML app!\\nAdding interactivity is surprisingly easy, thanks to HTMX. Modify the file to add this function:\\nmain.py\\n@rt(\\'/change\\')\\ndef get(): return P(\\'Nice to be here!\\')\\nYou now have a page with a clickable element that changes the text when clicked. When clicking on this link, the server will respond with an “HTML partial”—that is, just a snippet of HTML which will be inserted into the existing page. In this case, the returned element will replace the original P element (since that’s the default behavior of HTMX) with the new version returned by the second route.\\nThis “hypermedia-based” approach to web development is a powerful way to build web applications.\\nNext Steps\\nStart with the official sources to learn more about FastHTML:\\n- About: Learn about the core ideas behind FastHTML\\n- Documentation: Learn from examples how to write FastHTML code\\n- Idiomatic app: Heavily commented source code walking through a complete application, including custom authentication, JS library connections, and database use.\\nWe also have a 1-hour intro video:\\nThe capabilities of FastHTML are vast and growing, and not all the features and patterns have been documented yet. Be prepared to invest time into studying and modifying source code, such as the main FastHTML repo’s notebooks and the official FastHTML examples repo:\\nThen explore the small but growing third-party ecosystem of FastHTML tutorials, notebooks, libraries, and components:\\n- FastHTML Gallery: Learn from minimal examples of components (ie chat bubbles, click-to-edit, infinite scroll, etc)\\n- Creating Custom FastHTML Tags for Markdown Rendering by Isaac Flath\\n- Your tutorial here!\\nFinally, join the FastHTML community to ask questions, share your work, and learn from others:'"

Blogs are a good way to learn a web framework as they start simple yet can get surprisingly sophistated. The wikipedia definition of a blog is “an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts) informal diary-style text entries (posts)”, which means we need to provide these basic features:\\n- A list of articles\\n- A means to create/edit/delete the articles\\n- An attractive but accessible layout\\nWe’ll also add in these features, so the blog can become a working site:\\n- RSS feed\\n- Pages independent of the list of articles (about and contact come to mind)\\n- Import and Export of articles\\n- Tagging and categorization of data\\n- Deployment\\n- Ability to scale for large volumes of readers\\nHow to best use this tutorial\\nWe could copy/paste every code example in sequence and have a finished blog at the end. However, it’s debatable how much we will learn through the copy/paste method. We’re not saying its impossible to learn through copy/paste, we’re just saying it’s not that of an efficient way to learn. It’s analogous to learning how to play a musical instrument or sport or video game by watching other people do it - you can learn some but its not the same as doing.\\nA better approach is to type out every line of code in this tutorial. This forces us to run the code through our brains, giving us actual practice in how to write FastHTML and Pythoncode and forcing us to debug our own mistakes. In some cases we’ll repeat similar tasks - a key component in achieving mastery in anything. Coming back to the instrument/sport/video game analogy, it’s exactly like actually practicing an instrument, sport, or video game. Through practice and repetition we eventually achieve mastery.\\nInstalling FastHTML\\nFastHTML is just Python. Installation is often done with pip:\\npip install python-fasthtml\\nA minimal FastHTML app\\nFirst, create the directory for our project using Python’s pathlib module:\\nimport pathlib\\n\\'blog-system\\').mkdir() pathlib.Path(\\nNow that we have our directory, let’s create a minimal FastHTML site in it.\\nblog-system/minimal.py\\nfrom fasthtml.common import *\\n= fast_app()\\napp, rt\\n@rt(\"/\")\\ndef get():\\nreturn Titled(\"FastHTML\", P(\"Let\\'s do this!\"))\\nserve()\\nRun that with python minimal.py\\nand you should get something like this:\\npython minimal.py\\nLink: http://localhost:5001\\nINFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: [\\'/Users/pydanny/projects/blog-system\\']\\nINFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\\nINFO: Started reloader process [46572] using WatchFiles\\nINFO: Started server process [46576]\\nINFO: Waiting for application startup.\\nINFO: Application startup complete.\\nConfirm FastHTML is running by opening your web browser to 127.0.0.1:5001. You should see something like the image below:\\nimport *\\n?\\nFor those worried about the use of import *\\nrather than a PEP8-style declared namespace, understand that __all__\\nis defined in FastHTML’s common module. That means that only the symbols (functions, classes, and other things) the framework wants us to have will be brought into our own code via import *\\n. Read importing from a package) for more information.\\nNevertheless, if we want to use a defined namespace we can do so. Here’s an example:\\nfrom fasthtml import common as fh\\n= fh.fast_app()\\napp, rt\\n@rt(\"/\")\\ndef get():\\nreturn fh.Titled(\"FastHTML\", fh.P(\"Let\\'s do this!\"))\\nfh.serve()\\nLooking more closely at our app\\nLet’s look more closely at our application. Every line is packed with powerful features of FastHTML:\\nblog-system/minimal.py\\n- 1\\n- The top level namespace of Fast HTML (fasthtml.common) contains everything we need from FastHTML to build applications. A carefully-curated set of FastHTML functions and other Python objects is brought into our global namespace for convenience.\\n- 2\\n-\\nWe instantiate a FastHTML app with the\\nfast_app()\\nutility function. This provides a number of really useful defaults that we’ll modify or take advantage of later in the tutorial. - 3\\n-\\nWe use the\\nrt()\\ndecorator to tell FastHTML what to return when a user visits/\\nin their browser. - 4\\n-\\nWe connect this route to HTTP GET requests by defining a view function called\\nget()\\n. - 5\\n- A tree of Python function calls that return all the HTML required to write a properly formed web page. You’ll soon see the power of this approach.\\n- 6\\n-\\nThe\\nserve()\\nutility configures and runs FastHTML using a library calleduvicorn\\n. Any changes to this module will be reloaded into the browser.\\nAdding dynamic content to our minimal app\\nOur page is great, but we’ll make it better. Let’s add a randomized list of letters to the page. Every time the page reloads, a new list of varying length will be generated.\\nblog-system/random_letters.py\\n- 1\\n-\\nThe\\nstring\\nandrandom\\nlibraries are part of Python’s standard library - 2\\n-\\nWe use these libraries to generate a random length list of random letters called\\nletters\\n- 3\\n-\\nUsing\\nletters\\nas the base we use list comprehension to generate a list ofLi\\nft display components, each with their own letter and save that to the variableitems\\n- 4\\n-\\nInside a call to the\\nUl()\\nft component we use Python’s*args\\nspecial syntax on theitems\\nvariable. Therefore*list\\nis treated not as one argument but rather a set of them.\\nWhen this is run, it will generate something like this with a different random list of letters for each page load:\\nStoring the articles\\nThe most basic component of a blog is a series of articles sorted by date authored. Rather than a database we’re going to use our computer’s harddrive to store a set of markdown files in a directory within our blog called posts\\n. First, let’s create the directory and some test files we can use to search for:\\nSearching for these files can be done with pathlib.\\nimport pathlib\\nfor filename in pathlib.Path(\"posts\").rglob(\"*.md\"):\\nprint(filename)\\nposts/article_5.md\\nposts/article_1.md\\nposts/article_0.md\\nposts/article_4.md\\nposts/article_3.md\\nposts/article_7.md\\nposts/article_6.md\\nposts/article_2.md\\nposts/article_9.md\\nposts/article_8.md\\nPython’s pathlib library is quite useful and makes file search and manipulation much easier. There’s many uses for it and is compatible across operating systems.\\nCreating the blog home page\\nWe now have enough tools that we can create the home page. Let’s create a new Python file and write out our simple view to list the articles in our blog.',\n",

       " {'text': 'FastHTML\\nWelcome to the official FastHTML documentation.\\nFastHTML is a new next-generation web framework for fast, scalable web applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:\\n- Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced, interactive web apps you can imagine.\\n- Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more done.\\n- Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy to build complex apps quickly.\\nFastHTML apps are just Python code, so you can use FastHTML with the full power of the Python language and ecosystem. FastHTML’s functionality maps 1:1 directly to HTML and HTTP, but allows them to be encapsulated using good software engineering practices—so you’ll need to understand these foundations to use this library fully. To understand how and why this works, please read this first: about.fastht.ml.\\nInstallation\\nSince fasthtml\\nis a Python library, you can install it with:\\npip install python-fasthtml\\nIn the near future, we hope to add component libraries that can likewise be installed via pip\\n.\\nUsage\\nFor a minimal app, create a file “main.py” as follows:\\nmain.py\\nfrom fasthtml.common import *\\n= fast_app()\\napp,rt\\n@rt(\\'/\\')\\ndef get(): return Div(P(\\'Hello World!\\'), hx_get=\"/change\")\\nserve()\\nRunning the app with python main.py\\nprints out a link to your running app: http://localhost:5001\\n. Visit that link in your browser and you should see a page with the text “Hello World!”. Congratulations, you’ve just created your first FastHTML app!\\nAdding interactivity is surprisingly easy, thanks to HTMX. Modify the file to add this function:\\nmain.py\\n@rt(\\'/change\\')\\ndef get(): return P(\\'Nice to be here!\\')\\nYou now have a page with a clickable element that changes the text when clicked. When clicking on this link, the server will respond with an “HTML partial”—that is, just a snippet of HTML which will be inserted into the existing page. In this case, the returned element will replace the original P element (since that’s the default behavior of HTMX) with the new version returned by the second route.\\nThis “hypermedia-based” approach to web development is a powerful way to build web applications.\\nNext Steps\\nStart with the official sources to learn more about FastHTML:\\n- About: Learn about the core ideas behind FastHTML\\n- Documentation: Learn from examples how to write FastHTML code\\n- Idiomatic app: Heavily commented source code walking through a complete application, including custom authentication, JS library connections, and database use.\\nWe also have a 1-hour intro video:\\nThe capabilities of FastHTML are vast and growing, and not all the features and patterns have been documented yet. Be prepared to invest time into studying and modifying source code, such as the main FastHTML repo’s notebooks and the official FastHTML examples repo:\\nThen explore the small but growing third-party ecosystem of FastHTML tutorials, notebooks, libraries, and components:\\n- FastHTML Gallery: Learn from minimal examples of components (ie chat bubbles, click-to-edit, infinite scroll, etc)\\n- Creating Custom FastHTML Tags for Markdown Rendering by Isaac Flath\\n- Your tutorial here!\\nFinally, join the FastHTML community to ask questions, share your work, and learn from others:',\n",

There are many options in FastHTML to do this, and this section will walk through them. Generally you want to use the highest level option that fits your needs.\\nThis external tutorial walks through a practical situation where you may want to create a custom HTML tag using a custom ft component. Seeing a real-world example is a good way to understand why the contents of this guide is useful.\\nNotStr\\nThe first way is to use the NotStr\\nclass to use an HTML tag as a string. It works as a one-off but quickly becomes harder to work with as complexity grows. However we can see that you can genenrate the same xml using NotStr\\nas the out-of-the-box components.\\nAutomatic Creation\\nThe next (and better) approach is to let FastHTML generate the component function for you. As you can see in our assert\\nthis creates a function that creates the HTML just as we wanted. This works even though there is not a Some_never_before_used_tag\\nfunction in the fasthtml.components\\nsource code (you can verify this yourself by looking at the source code).\\nTypically these tags are needed because a CSS or Javascript library created a new XML tag that isn’t default HTML. For example the zero-md\\njavascript library looks for a <zero-md></zero-md>\\ntag to know what to run its javascript code on. Most CSS libraries work by creating styling based on the class\\nattribute, but they can also apply styling to an arbitrary HTML tag that they made up.\\nfrom fasthtml.components import Some_never_before_used_tag\\nSome_never_before_used_tag()\\nsome-never-before-used-tag></some-never-before-used-tag> <\\nManual Creation\\nThe automatic creation isn’t magic. It’s just calling a python function __getattr__\\nand you can call it yourself to get the same result.\\nimport fasthtml\\n= fasthtml.components.Some_never_before_used_tag()\\nauto_called = fasthtml.components.__getattr__(\\'Some_never_before_used_tag\\')()\\nmanual_called\\n# Proving they generate the same xml\\nassert to_xml(auto_called) == to_xml(manual_called)\\nKnowing that, we know that it’s possible to create a different function that has different behavior than FastHTMLs default behavior by modifying how the ___getattr__\\nfunction creates the components! It’s only a few lines of code and reading that what it does is a great way to understand components more deeply.\\nDunder methods and functions are special functions that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their name. They are called at specific times in python so you can use them to cause customized behavior that makes sense for your specific use case. They can appear magical if you don’t know how python works, but they are extremely commonly used to modify python’s default behavior (__init__\\nis probably the most common one).\\nIn a module __getattr__\\nis called to get an attribute. In fasthtml.components\\n, this is defined to create components automatically for you.\\nFor example if you want a component that creates <path></path>\\nthat doesn’t conflict names with pathlib.Path\\nyou can do that. FastHTML automatically creates new components with a 1:1 mapping and a consistent name, which is almost always what you want. But in some cases you may want to customize that and you can use the ft_hx\\nfunction to do that differently than the default.\\nfrom fasthtml.common import ft_hx\\ndef ft_path(*c, target_id=None, **kwargs):\\nreturn ft_hx(\\'path\\', *c, target_id=target_id, **kwargs)\\nft_path()\\npath></path> <\\nWe can add any behavior in that function that we need to, so let’s go through some progressively complex examples that you may need in some of your projects.\\nSymbols (ie @) in tag attributes\\nIt also may be that an argument in an HTML tag uses characters that can’t be used in python arguments. To handle these you can define those args using a dictionary.\\n=\\'normal stuff\\',**{\\'notNormal:arg:with_varing@symbols!\\':\\'123\\'}) Div(normal_arg\\n<div normal-arg=\"normal stuff\" notnormal:arg:with_varing@symbols!=\"123\"></div>',\n",

The syntax is largely the same as the wonderful FastAPI (which is what you should be using instead of this if you’re creating a JSON service. FastHTML is mainly for making HTML web apps, not APIs).\\nWe haven’t yet written complete documentation of all of FastHTML’s routing features – until we add that, the best place to see all the available functionality is to look over the tests\\nNote that you need to include the types of your parameters, so that FastHTML\\nknows what to pass to your function. Here, we’re just expecting a string:\\n= FastHTML()\\napp\\n@app.get(\\'/user/{nm}\\')\\ndef get_nm(nm:str): return f\"Good day to you, {nm}!\"\\nNormally you’d save this into a file such as main.py, and then run it in uvicorn\\nusing:\\nuvicorn main:app\\nHowever, for testing, we can use Starlette’s TestClient\\nto try it out:\\nfrom starlette.testclient import TestClient\\n= TestClient(app)\\nclient = client.get(\\'/user/Jeremy\\')\\nr r\\n<Response [200 OK]>\\nTestClient uses httpx\\nbehind the scenes, so it returns a httpx.Response\\n, which has a text\\nattribute with our response body:\\nr.text\\n\\'Good day to you, Jeremy!\\'\\nIn the previous example, the function name (get_nm\\n) didn’t actually matter – we could have just called it _\\n, for instance, since we never actually call it directly. It’s just called through HTTP. In fact, we often do call our functions _\\nwhen using this style of route, since that’s one less thing we have to worry about, naming.\\nAn alternative approach to creating a route is to use app.route\\ninstead, in which case, you make the function name the HTTP method you want. Since this is such a common pattern, you might like to give a shorter name to app.route\\n– we normally use rt\\n:\\n= app.route\\nrt\\n@rt(\\'/\\')\\ndef post(): return \"Going postal!\"\\n\\'/\\').text client.post(\\n\\'Going postal!\\'\\nRoute-specific functionality\\nFastHTML supports custom decorators for adding specific functionality to routes. This allows you to implement authentication, authorization, middleware, or other custom behaviors for individual routes.\\nHere’s an example of a basic authentication decorator:\\nfrom functools import wraps\\ndef basic_auth(f):\\n@wraps(f)\\nasync def wrapper(req, *args, **kwargs):\\n= req.headers.get(\"Authorization\")\\ntoken if token == \\'abc123\\':\\nreturn await f(req, *args, **kwargs)\\nreturn Response(\\'Not Authorized\\', status_code=401)\\nreturn wrapper\\n@app.get(\"/protected\")\\n@basic_auth\\nasync def protected(req):\\nreturn \"Protected Content\"\\n\\'/protected\\', headers={\\'Authorization\\': \\'abc123\\'}).text client.get(\\n\\'Protected Content\\'\\nThe decorator intercepts the request before the route function executes. If the decorator allows the request to proceed, it calls the original route function, passing along the request and any other arguments.\\nOne of the key advantages of this approach is the ability to apply different behaviors to different routes. You can also stack multiple decorators on a single route for combined functionality.\\ndef app_beforeware():\\nprint(\\'App level beforeware\\')\\n= FastHTML(before=Beforeware(app_beforeware))\\napp = TestClient(app)\\nclient\\ndef route_beforeware(f):\\n@wraps(f)\\nasync def decorator(*args, **kwargs):\\nprint(\\'Route level beforeware\\')\\nreturn await f(*args, **kwargs)\\nreturn decorator\\ndef second_route_beforeware(f):\\n@wraps(f)\\nasync def decorator(*args, **kwargs):\\nprint(\\'Second route level beforeware\\')\\nreturn await f(*args, **kwargs)\\nreturn decorator\\n@app.get(\"/users\")\\n@route_beforeware\\n@second_route_beforeware\\nasync def users():\\nreturn \"Users Page\"\\n\\'/users\\').text client.get(\\nApp level beforeware\\nRoute level beforeware\\nSecond route level beforeware\\n\\'Users Page\\'\\nThis flexiblity allows for granular control over route behaviour, enabling you to tailor each endpoint’s functionality as needed. While app-level beforeware remains useful for global operations, decorators provide a powerful tool for route-specific customization.\\nCombining Routes\\nSometimes a FastHTML project can grow so weildy that putting all the routes into main.py\\nbecomes unweildy. Or, we install a FastHTML- or Starlette-based package that requires us to add routes.\\nFirst let’s create a books.py\\nmodule, that represents all the user-related views:\\n# books.py\\n= fast_app()\\nbooks_app, rt\\n= [\\'A Guide to FastHTML\\', \\'FastHTML Cookbook\\', \\'FastHTML in 24 Hours\\']\\nbooks\\n@rt(\"/\", name=\"list\")\\ndef get():\\nreturn Titled(\"Books\", *[P(book) for book in books])\\nLet’s mount it in our main module:\\nfrom books import app as books_app\\n1= fast_app(routes=[Mount(\"/books\", books_app, name=\"books\")])\\napp, rt\\n@rt(\"/\")\\ndef get():\\nreturn Titled(\"Dashboard\",\\n2=\"/books\")(\"Books\")),\\nP(A(href\\nHr(),3=uri(\"books:list\"))(\"Books\")),\\nP(A(link\\n)\\nserve()\\n- 1\\n-\\nWe use\\nstarlette.Mount\\nto add the route to our routes list. We provide the name ofbooks\\nto make discovery and management of the links easier. More on that in items 2 and 3 of this annotations list - 2\\n- This example link to the books list view is hand-crafted. Obvious in purpose, it makes changing link patterns in the future harder\\n- 3\\n- This example link uses the named URL route for the books. The advantage of this approach is it makes management of large numbers of link items easier.',\n",

       " {'text': 'We import what we need for rapid development! A carefully-curated set of FastHTML functions and other Python objects is brought into our global namespace for convenience.\\n2\\nWe instantiate a FastHTML app with the fast_app() utility function. This provides a number of really useful defaults that we’ll take advantage of later in the tutorial.\\n3\\nWe use the rt() decorator to tell FastHTML what to return when a user visits / in their browser.\\n4\\nWe connect this route to HTTP GET requests by defining a view function called get().\\n5\\nA tree of Python function calls that return all the HTML required to write a properly formed web page. You’ll soon see the power of this approach.\\n6\\nThe serve() utility configures and runs FastHTML using a library called uvicorn.\\nRun the code:\\npython main.py\\nThe terminal will look like this:\\nINFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)INFO: Started reloader process [58058] using WatchFilesINFO: Started server process [58060]INFO: Waiting for application startup.INFO: Application startup complete.\\nConfirm FastHTML is running by opening your web browser to 127.0.0.1:5001. You should see something like the image below:\\nNote\\nWhile some linters and developers will complain about the wildcard import, it is by design here and perfectly safe. FastHTML is very deliberate about the objects it exports in fasthtml.common. If it bothers you, you can import the objects you need individually, though it will make the code more verbose and less readable.\\nIf you want to learn more about how FastHTML handles imports, we cover that here.\\nA Minimal Charting Application\\nThe Script function allows you to include JavaScript. You can use Python to generate parts of your JS or JSON like this:\\nWhen we can’t figure out a bug in FastHTML, we can run it in DEBUG mode. When an error is thrown, the error screen is displayed in the browser. This error setting should never be used in a deployed app.\\nPython throws an error when it tries to divide an integer by zero.\\nRouting\\nFastHTML builds upon FastAPI’s friendly decorator pattern for specifying URLs, with extra features:\\nmain.py\\nfrom fasthtml.common import*app, rt = fast_app()1@rt(\"/\")def get():return Titled(\"FastHTML\", P(\"Let\\'s do this!\"))2@rt(\"/hello\")def get():return Titled(\"Hello, world!\")serve()\\n1\\nThe “/” URL on line 5 is the home of a project. This would be accessed at 127.0.0.1:5001.\\n2\\n“/hello” URL on line 9 will be found by the project if the user visits 127.0.0.1:5001/hello.\\nTip\\nIt looks like get() is being defined twice, but that’s not the case. Each function decorated with rt is totally separate, and is injected into the router. We’re not calling them in the module’s namespace (locals()). Rather, we’re loading them into the routing mechanism using the rt decorator.\\nYou can do more! Read on to learn what we can do to make parts of the URL dynamic.\\nVariables in URLs\\nYou can add variable sections to a URL by marking them with {variable_name}. Your function then receives the {variable_name} as a keyword argument, but only if it is the correct type. Here’s an example:\\nmain.py\\nfrom fasthtml.common import*app, rt = fast_app()1@rt(\"/{name}/{age}\")2def get(name: str, age: int):3return Titled(f\"Hello {name.title()}, age {age}\")serve()\\n1\\nWe specify two variable names, name and age.\\n2\\nWe define two function arguments named identically to the variables. You will note that we specify the Python types to be passed.\\n3\\nWe use these functions in our project.\\nTry it out by going to this address: 127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5. You should get a page that says,\\n“Hello Uma, age 5”.\\nWhat happens if we enter incorrect data?\\nThe 127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5 URL works because 5 is an integer. If we enter something that is not, such as 127.0.0.1:5001/uma/five, then FastHTML will return an error instead of a web page.\\nFastHTML URL routing supports more complex types\\nThe two examples we provide here use Python’s built-in str and int types, but you can use your own types, including more complex ones such as those defined by libraries like attrs, pydantic, and even sqlmodel.\\nHTTP Methods\\nFastHTML matches function names to HTTP methods. So far the URL routes we’ve defined have been for HTTP GET methods, the most common method for web pages.\\nForm submissions often are sent as HTTP POST. When dealing with more dynamic web page designs, also known as Single Page Apps (SPA for short), the need can arise for other methods such as HTTP PUT and HTTP DELETE. The way FastHTML handles this is by changing the function name.\\nBy setting pico to False, FastHTML will not include pico.min.css.\\n2\\nThis will generate an HTML <link> tag for sourcing the css for Sakura.\\n3\\nIf you want an inline styles, the Style() function will put the result into the HTML.\\nOther Static Media File Locations\\nAs you saw, Script and Link are specific to the most common static media use cases in web apps: including JavaScript, CSS, and images. But it also works with videos and other static media files. The default behavior is to look for these files in the root directory - typically we don’t do anything special to include them.\\nFastHTML also allows us to define a route that uses FileResponse to serve the file at a specified path. This is useful for serving images, videos, and other media files from a different directory without having to change the paths of many files. So if we move the directory containing the media files, we only need to change the path in one place. In the example below, we call images from a directory called public.\\nfrom fasthtml.common import*hdrs = (MarkdownJS(), HighlightJS(langs=[\\'python\\', \\'javascript\\', \\'html\\', \\'css\\']), )app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)content =\"\"\"Here are some _markdown_ elements.- This is a list item- This is another list item- And this is a third list item**Fenced code blocks work here.**\"\"\"@rt(\\'/\\')def get(req):return Titled(\"Markdown rendering example\", Div(content,cls=\"marked\"))serve()\\nCode highlighting\\nHere’s how to highlight code without any markdown configuration.\\nfrom fasthtml.common import*# Add the HighlightJS built-in headerhdrs = (HighlightJS(langs=[\\'python\\', \\'javascript\\', \\'html\\', \\'css\\']),)app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)code_example =\"\"\"import datetimeimport timefor i in range(10): print(f\"{datetime.datetime.now()}\") time.sleep(1)\"\"\"@rt(\\'/\\')def get(req):return Titled(\"Markdown rendering example\", Div(# The code example needs to be surrounded by# Pre & Code elements Pre(Code(code_example)) ))serve()\\nDefining new ft components\\nWe can build our own ft components and combine them with other components. The simplest method is defining them as a function.\\ndef hero(title, statement):return Div(H1(title),P(statement), cls=\"hero\")# usage exampleMain( hero(\"Hello World\", \"This is a hero statement\"))\\n<main><div class=\"hero\"><h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a hero statement</p></div></main>\\nPass through components\\nFor when we need to define a new component that allows zero-to-many components to be nested within them, we lean on Python’s *args and **kwargs mechanism. Useful for creating page layout controls.\\ndef layout(*args, **kwargs):\"\"\"Dashboard layout for all our dashboard views\"\"\"return Main( H1(\"Dashboard\"), Div(*args, **kwargs), cls=\"dashboard\", )# usage examplelayout( Ul(*[Li(o) for o inrange(3)]), P(\"Some content\", cls=\"description\"),)\\nWhile functions are easy to read, for more complex components some might find it easier to use a dataclass.\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass@dataclassclass Hero: title: str statement: strdef __ft__(self):\"\"\" The __ft__ method renders the dataclass at runtime.\"\"\"return Div(H1(self.title),P(self.statement), cls=\"hero\")# usage exampleMain( Hero(\"Hello World\", \"This is a hero statement\"))\\n<main><div class=\"hero\"><h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a hero statement</p></div></main>\\nTesting views in notebooks\\nBecause of the ASGI event loop it is currently impossible to run FastHTML inside a notebook. However, we can still test the output of our views. To do this, we leverage Starlette, an ASGI toolkit that FastHTML uses.\\n# First we instantiate our app, in this case we remove the# default headers to reduce the size of the output.app, rt = fast_app(default_hdrs=False)# Setting up the Starlette test clientfrom starlette.testclient import TestClientclient = TestClient(app)# Usage example@rt(\"/\")def get():return Titled(\"FastHTML is awesome\", P(\"The fastest way to create web apps in Python\"))print(client.get(\"/\").text)\\n<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<title>FastHTML is awesome</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n<main class=\"container\">\\n<h1>FastHTML is awesome</h1>\\n<p>The fastest way to create web apps in Python</p>\\n</main>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\nStrings and conversion order\\nThe general rules for rendering are: - __ft__ method will be called (for default components like P, H2, etc. or if you define your own components) - If you pass a string, it will be escaped - On other python objects, str() will be called\\nAs a consequence, if you want to include plain HTML tags directly into e.g. a Div() they will get escaped by default (as a security measure to avoid code injections). This can be avoided by using NotStr(), a convenient way to reuse python code that returns already HTML. If you use pandas, you can use pandas.DataFrame.to_html() to get a nice table. To include the output a FastHTML, wrap it in NotStr(), like Div(NotStr(df.to_html())).\\nAbove we saw how a dataclass behaves with the __ft__ method defined. On a plain dataclass, str() will be called (but not escaped).\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass@dataclassclass Hero: title: str statement: str# rendering the dataclass with the default methodMain( Hero(\"<h1>Hello World</h1>\", \"This is a hero statement\"))\\n<main>Hero(title=\\'<h1>Hello World</h1>\\', statement=\\'This is a hero statement\\')</main>\\n# This will display the HTML as text on your pageDiv(\"Let\\'s include some HTML here: <div>Some HTML</div>\")\\n<div>Let\\'s include some HTML here: <div>Some HTML</div></div>\\n# Keep the string untouched, will be rendered on the pageDiv(NotStr(\"<div><h1>Some HTML</h1></div>\"))\\n<div><div><h1>Some HTML</h1></div></div>\\nCustom exception handlers\\nFastHTML allows customization of exception handlers, but does so gracefully. What this means is by default it includes all the <html> tags needed to display attractive content. Try it out!\\nfrom fasthtml.common import*def not_found(req, exc): return Titled(\"404: I don\\'t exist!\")exception_handlers = {404: not_found}app, rt = fast_app(exception_handlers=exception_handlers)@rt(\\'/\\')def get():return (Titled(\"Home page\", P(A(href=\"/oops\")(\"Click to generate 404 error\"))))serve()\\nWe can also use lambda to make things more terse:\\nfrom fasthtml.common import*exception_handlers={404: lambda req, exc: Titled(\"404: I don\\'t exist!\"),418: lambda req, exc: Titled(\"418: I\\'m a teapot!\")}app, rt = fast_app(exception_handlers=exception_handlers)@rt(\\'/\\')def get():return (Titled(\"Home page\", P(A(href=\"/oops\")(\"Click to generate 404 error\"))))serve()\\nCookies\\nWe can set cookies using the cookie() function. In our example, we’ll create a timestamp cookie.\\nfrom datetime import datetimefrom IPython.display import HTML\\n@rt(\"/settimestamp\")def get(req): now = datetime.now()return P(f\\'Set to {now}\\'), cookie(\\'now\\', datetime.now())HTML(client.get(\\'/settimestamp\\').text)\\nFastHTML page\\nSet to 2024-08-07 09:07:47.535449\\nNow let’s get it back using the same name for our parameter as the cookie name.\\n@rt(\\'/gettimestamp\\')def get(now:date): returnf\\'Cookie was set at time {now.time()}\\'client.get(\\'/gettimestamp\\').text\\n\\'Cookie was set at time 09:07:47.535456\\'\\nSessions\\nFor convenience and security, FastHTML has a mechanism for storing small amounts of data in the user’s browser. We can do this by adding a session argument to routes. FastHTML sessions are Python dictionaries, and we can leverage to our benefit. The example below shows how to concisely set and get sessions.\\n@rt(\\'/adder/{num}\\')def get(session, num: int): session.setdefault(\\'sum\\', 0) session[\\'sum\\'] = session.get(\\'sum\\') + numreturn Response(f\\'The sum is {session[\"sum\"]}.\\')\\nToasts (also known as Messages)\\nToasts, sometimes called “Messages” are small notifications usually in colored boxes used to notify users that something has happened. Toasts can be of four types:\\ninfo\\nsuccess\\nwarning\\nerror\\nExamples toasts might include:\\n“Payment accepted”\\n“Data submitted”\\n“Request approved”\\nToasts take a little configuration plus views that use them require the session argument.\\n1setup_toasts(app)@rt(\\'/toasting\\')2def get(session):# Normally one toast is enough, this allows us to see# different toast types in action. add_toast(session, f\"Toast is being cooked\", \"info\") add_toast(session, f\"Toast is ready\", \"success\") add_toast(session, f\"Toast is getting a bit crispy\", \"warning\") add_toast(session, f\"Toast is burning!\", \"error\")return Titled(\"I like toast\")\\n1\\nsetup_toasts is a helper function that adds toast dependencies. Usually this would be declared right after fast_app().\\n2\\nToasts require sessions.\\nAuthentication and authorization\\nIn FastHTML the tasks of authentication and authorization are handled with Beforeware. Beforeware are functions that run before the route handler is called. They are useful for global tasks like ensuring users are authenticated or have permissions to access a view.\\nFirst, we write a function that accepts a request and session arguments:\\n# Status code 303 is a redirect that can change POST to GET,# so it\\'s appropriate for a login page.login_redir = RedirectResponse(\\'/login\\', status_code=303)def user_auth_before(req, sess):# The `auth` key in the request scope is automatically provided# to any handler which requests it, and can not be injected# by the user using query params, cookies, etc, so it should# be secure to use. auth = req.scope[\\'auth\\'] = sess.get(\\'auth\\', None)# If the session key is not there, it redirects to the login page.ifnot auth: return login_redir\\nNow we pass our user_auth_before function as the first argument into a Beforeware class. We also pass a list of regular expressions to the skip argument, designed to allow users to still get to the home and login pages.',\n",

This is only tested for HF atm.\\nCall retr_info and then return id/subscriber value\\nAfter logging in via the provider, the user will be redirected back to the supplied redirect URL. The request to this URL will contain a code parameter, which is used to get an access token and fetch the user’s profile information. See the explainanation here for a worked example. You can either:\\nuse client.retr_info(code) to get all the profile information, or\\nuse client.retr_id(code) to get just the user’s ID.\\nAfter either of these calls, you can also access the access token (used to revoke access, for example) with client.token[\"access_token\"].',\n",

       " {'text': 'FAQ\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nWhy is FastHTML developed using notebooks?\\nSome people are under the impression that writing software in notebooks is bad.\\nWatch this video. We’ve used Jupyter notebooks exported via nbdev\\nto write a wide range of “very serious” software projects over the last three years. This includes deep learning libraries, API clients, Python language extensions, terminal user interfaces, web frameworks, and more!\\nnbdev is a Jupyter-powered tool for writing software. Traditional programming environments throw away the result of your exploration in REPLs or notebooks. nbdev\\nmakes exploration an integral part of your workflow, all while promoting software engineering best practices.\\nWhy not pyproject.toml for packaging?\\nFastHTML uses a setup.py\\nmodule instead of a pyproject.toml\\nfile to configure itself for installation. The reason for this is pyproject.toml\\nis not compatible with nbdev, which is what is used to write and build FastHTML.\\nThe nbdev project spent around a year trying to move to pyproject.toml but there was insufficient functionality in the toml-based approach to complete the transition. We invite those interested in moving this project pyproject.toml\\nto contribute their efforts to making nbdev work with that format.\\nWhy not JSX?\\nMany have asked! We think there’s no benefit… Python’s positional and kw args precisely 1:1 map already to html/xml children and attrs, so there’s no need for a new syntax.\\nWe wrote some more thoughts on Why Python HTML components over Jinja2, Mako, or JSX here.\\nWhy use import *\\nFirst, through the use of the __all__\\nattribute in our Python modules we control what actually gets imported. So there’s no risk of namespace pollution.\\nSecond, our style lends itself to working in rather compact Jupyter notebooks and small Python modules. Hence we know about the source code whose libraries we import *\\nfrom. This terseness means we can develop faster. We’re a small team, and any edge we can gain is important to us.\\nThird, for external libraries, be it core Python, SQLAlchemy, or other things we do tend to use explicit imports. In part to avoid namespace collisions, and also as reference to know where things are coming from.\\nWe’ll finish by saying a lot of our users employ explicit imports. If that’s the path you want to take, we encourage the use of from fasthtml import common as fh\\n. The acronym of fh\\nmakes it easy to recognize that a symbol is from the FastHTML library.\\nCan FastHTML be used for dashboards?\\nYes it can. In fact, it excels at building dashboards. In addition to being great for building static dashboards, because of its foundation in ASGI and tech stack, FastHTML natively supports Websockets. That means using FastHTML we can create dashboards that autoupdate.\\nWhy the distinctive coding style?\\nFastHTML coding style is the fastai coding style.\\nIf you are coming from a data science background the fastai coding style may already be your preferred style.\\nIf you are coming from a PEP-8 background where the use of ruff is encouraged, we won’t deny there is a learning curve. However, once you get used to the fastai coding style you may discover yourself appreciating the concise nature of this style. It also encourages using more functional programming tooling, which is both productive and fun.',\n",
